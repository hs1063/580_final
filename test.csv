Life is bassicly about learing new things every single day even though without experience because life is simple and we must live happy and around with the people we love. When a person thinks they know everything in life they dont do good because they trying to make the other person less then others you must be kind to those the dont have experience because you may not know some day you will go to a different country. When you dont know anyting because you not from their so you going to need help from others to explain you about the culture or how to eat a food because you have to no experience on the new country. You must help a person the has no experience because maybe you may need help from the person the you didnt want to help.

yes, even thought you may not have experience in the type of job you seek,you can learn and teach others.

If you dont have experence in a restaurant for the job you seek for you will learn. For example a person the has no experence working in a restaurant,the only place they will offer you would be to be a diswasher. But you want to dream big because everytime a person has big dreams they can learn the job whereever, you want to be like a cooking person or a kitchen manager. In a job there is always going to be people the they dont want to see you in a better place because they may think you dont deserve to be there but you the only one the knows how hard you being working to achieve your dream .In life you always going to have proof without experience to see how good you are to learn a new job in the kitchen so if you can learn quick. They can give you a good place for you teach others the has no experience.

My dad has always talk with my cousins that when their is no experience you can always learn and fight for what you want. When my cosuin came to America he wanted to play travel soccer, he went to tryout but the coach told him the has any experience of talking english so he wouldn't make it. But later on he learn how to speak then, he went to tryout for fc virginia he made it also everyone was talking about him because hes a great soccer player also, hes a great person. Then he came to the house and thanks my dad because of the edvice he gave to him the even though you dont have experience,you can always learn and fight for you goals. My dad is man the wants the best for hes family because when he was a kid he wanted to be a loyer but it was hard for hes parents because they were really poor and the corruption was really bad in the country.

In every job their is always going to be a person with no experience. For example people with no experience those are the ones the learn the job and when they learn the job very well they always try not to make a mistake because thay want to get the job done with quality. Because everytime you do a job for someone else they want to see good quality on you before they give the kind of job they want you to get done for them. The people the has no experience in a job that doesnt make them a less person because we all are humans and we must have the same equal rights. we all know the everytime you aplied for a job the first thing they asked you is about if you have experience but its okay to say no because they can teach you and you can get it fast.

I think yes, you can be a good candidate to be hire without no experience because every person in the world needs to have a opportunity to try something new. People today in life they dont need to have experience to go find a job why because today in every work you get one week of train which people can learn the job just in one week. Because they will practice the job and every time they get practice they will going to get better and better. Practices makes everything better so dont be scared to applied for job only because it says you must have experience no just go believe in youself. If you believe in you everything will be good in like ad you will be going great just be you even though you have experience or not we all deserve a chance."
1,000BAD50D026,"Do you think students would benefit from being able attend classes from home?

Yes! its benefit for student who attend classes from home. Because some student want to attend classes from home because they thinks it's very important for them . And they think they can learned fast, and understand than they student who attend classes from school. For example my friend told me that she's attand classes from home it's good for her, because they is some subject she didn't understand when she attend classes from school but when she attend the home classes she good for that subject. she like science she think science its important for her but she didn't understand anything any science but she understand science because she attend classes from home. And some parent doesn't want they are children to attend classes from school, because many christian doesn't want they are children to attend to classes from school because they doesn't believe science and they want they are children to be disrespectful for teacher or for them. Maybe student can deciding to attend classes from home because it's benefit for them and it's good for the people who have lot of money. It's not any people who can attend classes from home.

some student attend classes from home because they hate bull or trouble. because they is student who come to school to bull other student or to fight with other. I know they is some people who scared about fight or bull by someone. For example the was a girl who attend very day to school and they was three girl they bull and beat her everyday and try to kill her self because she think she doesn't have anyone who can fight for her and when her parent sigh her want to kill herself, immediately they stop her, and they say they can not let they children to go back for school and they think every school it's like that school. so that why attand class from home it's good sometime. They are student who attend classes from home for the reason because to provide the experience and to show that they can try to learned themselves. In order to achieve anything at all in life a attend classes from home would must being take a deciding whether. "
2,00367BB2546B,"Thomas Jefferson once states that ""it is wonderful how much we can get done when we are always doing something,I agree to this statement. Some people say that it is always better to always be doing something than to be inactive and so nothing at all to chase after on your dreams. always doing something lets you feel a sense of accomplishment,it makes you want to strive to do even more than what you did,you can also learn something along the way.

The first reason that always doing is better than doing nothing is that it gives you a sense of you accomplishing something. when you finish a task you feel successful with yourself in saying that you pursued something and kept going. for example,when you graduate from school and move on to collage,you feel successful you also know that you worked as hard as you can to complete your schooling and onto collage or even to the real world to work.

Secondly,accomplishing your goals makes you want to strive to do more. when you complete something you may think to yourself,""if I did this than what else can i did with my life?"". Accomplishing something could make you want to do even more. For example, when you finish such as school then later move out of the house and live on you own,it gives you a sense of you being an independent person and you having the capability to live on you own and also to manage you own life how you want it to be. lastly it gives you the chance to go higher in your career.

Finally it give you the opportunity to learn new and useful thing along the way that you may be able to use in your own life. by accomplishing something you can learn how to help you self to accomplish new and better things in you life. For example ,by finishing school you will take all that you learned and you can apply it it some aspect of your life to help you succeed in life. You can also apply it to the job you pursue or even to get a higher education.

Although some may disagree with me and say that inactivity is helpful when trying to accomplish something because it will not cause stress on you ,what this fails to show is that it lets you become a better person in your day to day life. in conclusion always doing is better than doing nothing because it helps you achieve more in you life,makes you feel accomplished in life, and shows that you can always strive to do more in you life "
3,hp,"Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward 
over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a 
baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black hair 
over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped 
cut, like a bolt of lightning. 

“Is that where — ?” whispered Professor McGonagall. 

“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “Hell have that scar forever.” 

“Couldn’t you do something about it, Dumbledore?” 

“Even if I could, I wouldn’t. Scars can come in handy. 

I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect 
map of the London Underground. Well — give him 
here, Hagrid — we’d better get this over with.” 

Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned 
toward the Dursleys’ house. 

“Could I — could I say good-bye to him, sir?” asked 
Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry 
and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, 
whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl 
like a wounded dog. 

“Shhh!” hissed Professor McGonagall, “you’ll wake the 
Muggles!” 

“S-s-sorry,” sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted 
handkerchief and burying his face in it. “But I c-c- 
can’t stand it — Lily an’ James dead — an’ poor little 
Harry off ter live with Muggles — ” 

“Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, 
Hagrid, or we’ll be found,” Professor McGonagall 
whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as 
Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and 
walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the 
doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it 
inside Harry’s blankets, and then came back to the 
other two. For a full minute the three of them stood 
and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders 
shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and 
the twinkling light that usually shone from 
Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone out. 

“Well,” said Dumbledore finally, “that’s that. We’ve no 
business staying here. We may as well go and join the 
celebrations.” 

“Yeah,” said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, “I’d best 
get this bike away. G ’night, Professor McGonagall — 
Professor Dumbledore, sir.” 

Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid 
swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the 
engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off 
into the night. 

“I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,” 
said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor 
McGonagall blew her nose in reply. 

Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. 
On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put- 
Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light 
sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive 
glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a 
tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end 
of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets 
on the step of number four. 

“Good luck, Harry,” he murmured. He turned on his 
heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone. 

A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which 
lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last ” 

He found what he was looking for in his inside 
pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He 
flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. 
The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He 
clicked it again — the next lamp flickered into 
darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, 
until the only lights left on the whole street were two 
tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of 
the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their 
window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they 
wouldn’t be able to see anything that was happening 
down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put- 
Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the 
street toward number four, where he sat down on the 
wall next to the cat. He didn’t look at it, but after a 
moment he spoke to it.

4,tkm,"Being Southerners, it was a source of shame to some members of the family that  we had no recorded ancestors on either side of the Battle of Hastings. All we had  was Simon Finch, a fur-trapping apothecary from Cornwall whose piety was  exceeded only by his stinginess. In England, Simon was irritated by the  persecution of those who called themselves Methodists at the hands of their more  liberal brethren, and as Simon called himself a Methodist, he worked his way  across the Atlantic to Philadelphia, thence to Jamaica, thence to Mobile, and up  the Saint Stephens. Mindful of John Wesley’s strictures on the use of many words  in buying and selling, Simon made a pile practicing medicine, but in this pursuit  he was unhappy lest he be tempted into doing what he knew was not for the glory  of God, as the putting on of gold and costly apparel. So Simon, having forgotten  his teacher’s dictum on the possession of human chattels, bought three slaves and  with their aid established a homestead on the banks of the Alabama River some  forty miles above Saint Stephens. He returned to Saint Stephens only once, to find  a wife, and with her established a line that ran high to daughters. Simon lived to  an impressive age and died rich. 
It was customary for the men in the family to remain on Simon’s homestead,  Finch’s Landing, and make their living from cotton. The place was self-sufficient:  modest in comparison with the empires around it, the Landing nevertheless  produced everything required to sustain life except ice, wheat flour, and articles  of clothing, supplied by river-boats from Mobile. 
Simon would have regarded with impotent fury the disturbance between the North  and the South, as it left his descendants stripped of everything but their land, yet  the tradition of living on the land remained unbroken until well into the twentieth  century, when my father, Atticus Finch, went to Montgomery to read law, and his  younger brother went to Boston to study medicine. Their sister Alexandra was the  Finch who remained at the Landing: she married a taciturn man who spent most  of his time lying in a hammock by the river wondering if his trot-lines were full. When my father was admitted to the bar, he returned to Maycomb and began his  practice. Maycomb, some twenty miles east of Finch’s Landing, was the county 
seat of Maycomb County. Atticus’s office in the courthouse contained little more  than a hat rack, a spittoon, a checkerboard and an unsullied Code of Alabama. His  first two clients were the last two persons hanged in the Maycomb County jail.  Atticus had urged them to accept the state’s generosity in allowing them to plead  Guilty to second-degree murder and escape with their lives, but they were  Haverfords, in Maycomb County a name synonymous with jackass. The  Haverfords had dispatched Maycomb’s leading blacksmith in a misunderstanding  arising from the alleged wrongful detention of a mare, were imprudent enough to  do it in the presence of three witnesses, and insisted that the-son-of-a-bitch-had-it coming-to-him was a good enough defense for anybody. They persisted in  pleading Not Guilty to first-degree murder, so there was nothing much Atticus  could do for his clients except be present at their departure, an occasion that was  probably the beginning of my father’s profound distaste for the practice of  criminal law.

5,high school,"With the development of the technology, more and more machines start to appear in our life. The invention of machines is rapidly developed. The concept of a thinking machine has been around for thousands of years and is something humans seem obsessed with - from the Greek myth of Pygmalion, a statue brought to life, through to the automata of Victorian society, we have long dreamed of putting human characteristics into machines.( Jane Wakefield. "" Intelligent machines: Will we accept robot revolution?"" 7 October 2015. Web. 8 January 2016.) Nowadays, machines play an important role in our lives, and some intelligent machines can help us to do something with sophisticated technologies. Machines influenced people very much, and their influences of people can be classified into three categories: increasing productivity, pushing development and avoiding dangers.
Primarily, the machine can increase the productivity on some industries, and it is very helpful for human. The use of the machines increased our productivity rapidly, and the machines could replace human to do low-skill works more efficiently and accurate. For instance, in the first decade of the twentieth century, Ford, the pioneer in automobile industry, wanted to make cars affordable for every individual. The idea that everyone can afford a car seemed ridiculous to all people when Henry Ford first sought financial backing for making cars, the very notion of farmers and clerks owning automobiles was considered ridiculous. However, Ford was very clever to produce cars on assembly lines, so it greatly decreased consume and cost of the production, and the Ford’s dream came true. According this example, we can know that machines can increase the productivity, and it can decrease the cost, so it is beneficial for human to some extent."
6,college1,"“We need to move to a place with an elevator.”
 
    I can’t remember how many times I heard my grandparents say these words. Our apartment was located on the top floor of a dilapidated building without an elevator in the oldest area of Beijing. For years, I saw my grandparents climb stairs with sweat on their backs and a sighs of tiredness. Over time, the simplest trips became extremely hard for them.
 
    I was raised by my grandparents, both of whom were civil engineers. They designed and built buildings in Beijing. They proudly called themselves “home providers”. I looked at the tall buildings they pointed at and agreed, “Yes, they are home providers. Wherever they go is my home.” At age six, I moved to another city with my parents. Seeing the curious street views and listening to the different accents, I followed my parents who were as unfamliar as the city was to me. I wondered, “where is my home?”
 
    “We really need to move,” my mother suggested. Our dining table filled with advertisements of different projects with prices highlighted: Six million! Ten million! I looked outside the window at buildings standing there as great monsters swallowing money. We couldn’t afford them. Are they worth it? Where will our home be? Suddenly, great monsters became huge cages built with concrete and steel – which reminded me something I saw before.
 
I volunteered at a panda base during the summer. The pandas I saw before were quiet, staying in cages for people to observe. However, the ones I saw at the panda base were jumping, climbing, relaxing as no one watched. They had their own characters. I started to think: where is their “home” The cage we used to protect them, or mountains they came from? As people define“home” for pandas, what defines “home” for people? Economy? Society? Prices and values determine homes for people, not people themselves. 
 
    Everyday, I see homeless people. When storms come, there is no roof over their head and no walls to protect them. I hear stories about people from near and far coming to Beijing, with dreams of finding their luck, earning better lives, but leaving with deep disappointment. They can’t stay because they have nowhere to settle in this busy city; People try to find homes here. What does “home” mean to them?
 
    “People are always buying apartments. ”There is a market.” “There is no acknowledgment explaining the economic aspect of the Chinese housing industry.” Hearing this, it seemed to me that people didn’t care about housing prices. I started to find answers by looking up data from the National Bureau of Statistics, where I observed and compared housing prices to people’s average income for the past 6 years. I discovered that the housing price growth rate is far faster than the income growth rate. This happens because people crave buying apartments for investment and real property companies crave money.This must stop before housing prices so unrealistic that we lose our homes, and have to earn them back.
 
Reflecting on my family, people on the streets, and pandas, I kept thinking: what is the real definition of home? It is hard to describe in one word. Home is our apartment; home is our identity; home is the world; home is responsibility; home is success; home is love. Home is a warm and important word for every creature, but not everyone can have a home, because of human interference, because of ridiculous housing prices. I am lucky to have a wonderful home, but it isn’t enough: homes are challenged, homes are lost. I desire to challenge the problem with my humble effort: researching and educating about housing prices. I believe, society should care about its people; people should care about each other. I hope, someday, knowing the real definition and having a wonderful home won’t be a dream but a fact for every creature living in this world."
7,college2,"In the article “Beyond borders: what it means to be a global citizen” the author, Drew Noble Alexander, mentions a global situation that more students are studying abroad than before. He calls those people “global citizens” and explains the ideal model as being “global citizens ” through several ways. First, he defines “global citizens” as people who are travelling and studying in other countries. Secondly, he believes actual “global citizens” are people who are willing to take risks, collect data from their education, and use their knowledge to deal with real world crisis. Thirdly, even though  there are more challenges that international students nowadays have than global generations from 20th century, they will need to work cooperatively and generate more originative ideas. Moreover, Alexander states that the best way to build a foundation for their future generations is to encouraging children to speak out their opinions and inspire their potential.  

According to my personal experience as an international student, I totally agree with Alexander’s idea that “students need critical thinking skills, a level of self-awareness and confidence that will empower them to take on unfamiliar challenges.” When I study in the United States, not only do I need to get used to studying in a second language, but I also have to be accustomed to a totally different critical thinking method. Additionally, Alexander points  out that being a global citizen means that every person has responsibility to make use of their knowledge to make the world better. In my opinion, studying abroad is a good way to help students gain crossing cultural information, which will provide them more opportunities for future development. However, I state a contrary opinion on the idea that Alexander claims, “Global citizenship cannot be taught, rather, it must be developed and cultivated.” I think new generations of “global citizens” need to learn the previous “global citizenship” first before they develop their own style “global citizenship” to avoid the cultural conflict at the first time going abroad."
