**Introduction and EDA**

The use of auto-feedback systems to evaluate students\' writing
abilities is becoming increasingly common in education. These systems
rely on algorithms to assess writing in terms of grammar, word use, and
other aspects. However, current auto-feedback systems need to be better
suited for evaluating the writing of English as a Second Language (ESL)
students. In this study, we aim to develop an effective model for
assessing the writing skills of ESL students in grades 8-12.

The dataset used in this study consists of two parts: a training set
with 3911 student essays and scores in six different areas (cohesion,
syntax, vocabulary, phraseology, grammar, and conventions), and a test
set with three student essays, two book passages, and three essays
written by our group members.

The accompanying distribution figure shows the length of essays written
by ESL students in grades 8-12. The distribution is slightly skewed to
the right, with a mean length of approximately 440 words. This suggests
that few of the 3911 essays are particularly long.
