Practicing is important because. One example is when I learn how to play soccer. The person that teach me was my cousin Im still bad but Im learning. Another Example would be when

I learn how to bould on fornite. I learn how to bould and sauces by my cousin. Lastly when I learn how to aim on fornite. I learn because of my cousin and he teach me how. Learning a skill Is better then not to.

Being pation Is good for you for example. One time when I was trying to bould hard thing on fornite and it didn't work so i got mad. But then I tried doing net part by part and I got what I wanted. Another example would be I was Inpatient of swimming on deep water. But then I learn how to swim on deep water. When I wanted to go on a water park I was inpatient. But I learn be pation Is good. I was waiting then got in the park and it was fun. In some cases Is better to be pation then not to.

Loaning a tik tok daced for me Is a skill. For example one dace would when I made my own dance. It was easy and I lorn. Another example would be a hard danced. I tried to duet but it was to hard so I quit. Lastly would be A danced that was hard but

I did step by step and I enjoyed. Loaning can sometimes be fun.

Practecsin is the way to success. An example would be a hard assignment that I did and it was hard. Second would be pattion when I need to. For example when I play to much games Im pattion and not getting mad. Lastly learning fun skills. Hard daces can be challenging but once I lornet it was fun. Doing all of this thing made my skills useful In life and Im happy that I now all of this skills.     ",2.5,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.2,0

Especially if they are important persons like friends,family,or girlfriend in those cases People get afraid to loose them or make them unhappy.

""JOHN LUBBOCK"" once wrote a amazing quote that speaks the true. ""your character will be what you yourself choose to make of it. that quote along changed my mindset, many people would disagree with John and his way of thinking but i personal agree with what he wrote,theres a lot of true behind his words, People shouldn't focus about others opinions or let bad experiences or events shape its character. I personal believe characters arent beyond our control after all we are the ones that control our way of thinking and reacting to them. My self has seen my tree closes friends Generic_Name,Generic_Name and Generic_Name ended up really bad after they decide to let bad events,experiences, and opinions shape the way of their characters.

Generic_Name one of my closest friend decided to let one big events shape his character and at the end everything went wrong for my dear friend. When he was a little kid he contently got hit by his parents in he grew up mad and he started using violence at school he would get in trouble all the time and his parents would get super mad and would use violence against him too they say it was to ""teach him a lesson"" everything went like that for him until many years passed and he got married and he contently used violence every time she did something wrong, he was mad about what its parents did to him so he would always hit his wife until one day he end up killing her and himself.

Generic_Name my other close friend let experiences shape his character in a bad way.

when he was a young man falling a love with pretty girls many of those girls just wanted to play with his feelings. Those girls never took him seriously until one day he got tired of the way girls would treat him and he loose feeling and he become just like those girls he didn't like at first. My friend Generic_Name started playing with girls feeling and he end up by him self and never finding true love, one he got true love but bad experiences make him loose feelings for all females and he played the one true love he had.

Generic_Name friend of mine let opinions got the best of him, he was contently trying to be someone he wasn't just so people he love would love him back but at the end he was just hurting him self because he wasn't happy like that he was just lying to himself and acting for other people.

people dont let bad experiences events or opinion to shape the character you yourself control or every one would end up like my friends that decided to let others control what they would have to.

2203,A46DA0EA4F5D,"Four-day School

Debate between benefits and disadvanges. Resume any doing school activities on regular five school day and change that for only four day.

To have a four-day school week, is an option that has to be adopted not only for some of the businesses workers and also by each high school and higher education school after see this reasons.

That is consisting of lose ten hour per week. but those missing hour can be recoup it by extending the school day two hour and increase the time for each class per day, that is an option to increase the atention and time on each class and complete any proyect or assigment toll by your teacher, and if we get the extra two hours, we can get more time with friends and teacher for suport between us on any class someone is failing.

Also, we can adopted an option for the fourth day on the extra two hours, used for time on the library, that can be amazing for the sturent who love reading, or students who love extra time on the sports, or any activity after school.

The fifth day of the week can be used for doctor appoinments or any health situations, you know the great excuse for missing classes on regular school time is because the parents write a note explaining we will be absent of some periods of classes. Doing any that situation on not regular time of school will deacrese the sturent missing on any period of class.

Without forget the teacher's situations who are the parents at the same time and need one extra day for family time and doing regular acctivities with their sons if that they have.

Don't forget the situations on seniors who are the most difficult situations on their life, decide for future, and they need time for keeping all option from universities and college for do the next step, higher education nad considered also job for weekends, also about freshman, who are the chlidren from middle school, they are the situation on needing understanding from extra activities on high school changed from their last rutine.

Another opctions for Friday or Monday free day can be used for community service, with permition of parent and some supervision of some adults, any students who wants participate on this can go and help on cleaning up street and river or any help on relation with community service, also the schools can create any program that consist on get many big companies who wants help students find a job on this new free day and may be part-time on weekend.

Considering:

Only four-day school, forget about the fifth day on school (No coming a little time for five days use the full time on four days)

three free days per week (use this extra time on family or friends meeting, any thing you and your parents want)

No wake up on Friday mornings or may be Monday mornings (dependes on the detition of the school about which day is going to be the third free day, use time for rest and complete responsabilities)

This idea can be not convenient for students with part-time job, because by following this model by extending the school day two hour will decrease the student's time sheet, even though if every one on this situation can use the fifth school day that will be free for a full-time job and get three full-time job.

Always remain. BE ON TWO DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES PER DAY CAN BE HARD AND EXHAUSTING, going school than going to work is exhausting because you don't have time for rest. But, if you get only four school days even though the school increase two hours you will have time after school for rest and doing any proyect or homework and use the other three days for any job you think is convenient.

Knowing disadvantages also remain the solutions and benefits for each disagreement on this proyect, because there are ore of the benefits than disadvantages for more 90 percent of the students.

After mention all points on considering benefits and disadvantages and solutions on that. To a four-day school week. Willingly I conclude with ""Everyone need a three day free from school and just four days on school"". Even though if any student's situation is diferent for using this free day, stay in home, family rutines, helping on home rutines, working or studing. And considering we every one are agree with all on this document, we all together will have the power to do a fight for this new right on high school and college's sturents.

I think students would not benefit being able to attend classes from home because they can not be on their telephone and not due what they are spouse to due.

First, they can get distracted, In my position

I Can get distracted went I am at home doing homework i want to wache TV even some time I do not finish my homework because i get a lot distracted. I want to play whit my brothers go out side play soccer and i say just for a little I am to playing with then but a get distracted and i for got the i have to do homework or study for a test. Some time I get distracted by seeing my brother playing video even went they is a lot of noise i get distracted because i want to what is happening or what is going on. I remember one day the I have to finish a test review at home because I do not have time to do it at school I do not finish because I get distracted by brothers. They were making a lot of noise and i could no concentrate because of then. My brothers are the same way as me they can get distracted fully easy and not pay attention on what they doing maybe they star by doing they homework but they do no finish because they get distracted by the TV or the video game.

Second, they can use the telephone some time I get a lot distracted whit my telephone because I away want to be in the telephone. Went i home I just want to be in my telephone and i do not do my homework. I get fully distracted because I want to text whit my friends or playing video games in my telephone and not Du what i suppose to to do. Went I am at home I have all I want my bed my telephone the TV the I forgot the I have to how or study for a quiz or test. Only because I at home and I have all i need some time i do not want to do anything

I get distracted fully easy and more if I have my telephone in front of me because i want to leasing to music or video chat my friend and talk and pay attention on what I suppose to due. Some time my mom tell that I have to stuff in the house so I have to do it even if I am doing homework or studying I have to what she say and then a can kip doing what i was doing. If I have my telephone whit me the only thing i what to do is be in the telephone because it is a easy way to get distracted and not due what you suppose to due.

Some people my say that if students have home school it will be good because some students can get bully at school and they do not want to go back. The is say for then because some the students do not ride the bus the parent have to take then to school and the take a lot of time some time because they have to wait. Even they are going late for work and they do not have tame to take then to school. They may say the if they have school at home they do not have to do all the work by taking then to school. some time a lot of kids get bully at school and it more easy for then do do it by home because they do not have to deal with at school they do to have to be worry what would happen to then the net they or what does people are going to do whit then, But I chose to not have school at because some people can get distracted I not saying the all people have the problem I am just saying the i have the problem they my not have. But I do not like have home school because i want to see my friend graduate whit then have fun some time go to party and now more people have more experience.

In solution, people can do what is best for you if you like do school by home because you do not like people or have personal problem or have i disability that you go it no one is going to say anything. But some time people want to have friends have fun because you are a person the like to be around people that good to. the only thing i am saying chose what is best for you not what is best for other people or what other people think.

have good relationship with your friends and make someone trust in you to tell their secret to you. Well that is what i think about Seeking multiple opinion.

Seeking multiple opinion can make someone trust in you. When someone trust in you, he or she can tell you their secret about everything they have in secret. If someone trust in you he or she will know that you are a good friend. For example,

if you do something wrong to your friend who trust in you, She or her is going to forgive you when you say sorry because, he or she trust in you. Being nice and respectful for example, not saying bad word to someone to be depressed, saying please when you are asking someone for something can also make someone trust in you.

Seeking multiple opinion can make you have good relationship with someone.

Having a good relationship with someone is a good thing to do in life.

Having a good relationship with someone can make him or her get close to you . Helping your friend for example, helping him or her with his homework or something he or she needs help with , advising him or her to do the right if he or her did something wrong, being nice and respectful to everyone can also make someone have a good relationship with you.

Seeking multiple opinion allow you to make new friends. Sometime when you are making new friends you dont just have to make friends, you have to think about it .

Make a friend who respect everyone, correct you when you do something wrong and someone who is there for you because, when something happen to and you have a bad friend, he or she will not help you but, If you have a good friend, he or she will help you when you are in a bad situation.

People who stop and fail they don't learn from there mistake. The ones who fail and self believe they learn form past mistakes and try again. By practicing over time the person can understand the subject or the materials they'er trying to learn thats how some people can be successful. People who don't practice the won't get any where in life or get to there goals where they need it to be.

Winston Churchill say ""susses is consists of going to failure with out loss of enthusiasm"" yes i do agree with his saying. The reason being if you fail for an example on a math test you got an 53 but now this time on the retake you want to get a 80 now that's a goal you want to achieve. By practicing over time people can learn there mistakes from there past experiences and see how the develop over time. People who become famous, millionaires, and company owners they had good and bad ideas but they still became rich or powerful people by learning their mistakes. Winston Churchill is tilling us that by failure and believing in our self we can successful.

There are many ways to be successful to get where the person wants be to. The first step is were and how to start company or store. Second step is how to get the money, recourse, and a company to. Will the two steps are that easy,step number 1 always start off small use a room or make a stand out of wood if that doesn't come up with other ways. The second step buy the material off the item the cost mummers are buying if that a back fires you can always use you own money to buy the rests like company poster. Thats how some people can have bad or good ideas.

In conclusion people can be successful or not by learning the mistakes they make in the past. Finding a way of how people can practice there mistakes an be more productive in the future. Sitting a goals and having more of what you expected to have for example have a higher score on a math test. Having ideas and recourse to start small business.

Conserving energy is a good thing for people but children need time for school, with not that much time for school we are going to have a lot of people failing or droping out.

3152,DE3867FD43DE,"well hello today I will discust the diferent between working wit a group or working alone first let me ask you a question how hyou like to? with a group or alone? well i chose working with a group lets see why...

working in group and working alone have advantages and disavantages for each one,I like wirking as a group because your team can help you with some ideas and ways to do your work and at the same time have fun while your are doing the work. disavantages in a group there will be always a person that want to be just playing around and don't like to do any type of work just have fun. nut if we being on the side of be working alone thant advantage will be that you will have more oportunity of do your work the way you want to and no be worry about other people opinion. you will finish your work faster and the way you want the wor kto be done,but some disvantages you will no have fun because you have no one to be with and it will be difficult to have a lot of ideas. i think working with a group is more beneficial because if you think there will be more people at the ppresentation helping you and you will feel more secure with your work.

working with a group can help you to increase your skill level of talking and self confidence and being social(meet new friends) , working alone can sometimes can get borring and you dont finish the work because you don't have someone to share the ideas with,

workingt alone can cause you a damage on yuor personalty and your aparetion people will think i he don't like workign with aother person around that he should work by it self andf then there will be a lot of caos that person fall in depresion because no one acept him and it was because you make them to be like that or feel that way.

while you are working with a group you learn skilll like having respect for others and diferentsd way of doing things and work as a team,or even for example you love play sport well you can not do it by your self because there will be team, and how you will work as a team with out learning how to work as a group, you need to learn how to work as a team if you want to be succesful in the comunity, in your future working with a group with the perople you trust you learn that friendship is alway good for you have thar confident that people you like being with help you to increase on your life that is a feel that no one can easy aford it.

went oyu are working with a group friendship will always be there why because is the keey of being succesful on your life. in your future, and your career, in your job.

for example;

lets said that you was driving on the higway driving normal but you forgot to past by the gas station you are in the middle of the street you don't have gas well if you don't like to work with a group then you will push your car and problably you will end up getting a desease or crashing another car.

while if you learn how to work as a group then you can have four people helping you push your car others stop the traffic and some calling the police to help you with that issue.

now you see why it is importan to learn and work as a group, even though with that you already meet new people and have new friend,what I try to said is that working with a group help you a lot in harders things that you need help with.

working alone is depent of what kind of personality you have and if you love working with out people than is fine but there will alway a time that you have to work as a team or group becasue there are things that someone by them self can not accomplish.

when you work as a group you gain respect and great friend ship because if you help with everything then everyone will love working with you and you now will feel that you are important and useful, something that working alone it will be dificult to make.

well i hope you like my explanation i did my best and i feel that we should be more socialize with other nad let then join us for our better future so they can have friends and they never feel like their are alone, lets make everyone happy and having a good time helping other and always respectful.",2.0,2.0,2.5,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.3,0

My grandma, always said that being in a group gives you more things to talk about. The benefits of working a group is more beneficial because,more ideas, partisan,and some one you can talk to.

Many calm that working alone will not share your ideas with other clearly, it better working in a group have fun and to talk to others.

To begin the benefits of working in a group is more beneficial because having more ideas. For example my sister, Generic_Name she loves sharing her ideas. Each ideas they share with they classmates. They can have have a example on what there writing about and have an idea on what there talking about. For example my Mom,is A fourth grad teacher she loves seeing others sharing it means a lot to her. She partners up the kids and so she, can see on thing the can come up with. However,having more ideas well help us share ans being thoughtfully to other in life.

In addishly,the benefits of working with group is more benefice because, to pertipat in a class room. For example when i first stared middle school i didnt want ti partisan with no on. Because, i wanted to work bye my self. Later that week i made a Friend and, she intrdust me to the other class mats, we all disided to be together for this school project. Example my little brother Generic_Name ,he was shy to talk to others in the class room. I as an oldest sister, to if him they no need to be shy just talk to others and pertipat in class and get to know every one. that next day my brother was happy to with others. However,partisan is a good way to show others an example and make new friends

Finely the benefits of working in a group is more beneficial because, having some one to talk to for example my friend Generic_Name, didnt have have nothing tot talk to for example my friend Generic_Name,didnt have nothing to think of .I was helping her on some thing we can together thinks of. I as a friend was there to listened to was she had to say. Example my other friend she wasnt at school because,her Grandpa, pasted away she misted on what we were working on. So i want to show her on the thinks she missed out. It helped her a lot.

2913,D242BBCBEAFB,"Some student can take classes at home because they could find a subject of course that like. Learning websites can help them get better at what they do. It could benefit because they it would seem easier to go on different classes or to take a video to study a subject. For example, taking classes online would give you a head start. Many other schools have students at home take taking these course and have them apply for it. It is like a benefit for them to take some opportunity to get taught about something they have learn or to have a different way of learning it.

I will think they would able to do this if they are interested. For example, Home-schooling could that much money. There could be some reasons for them.

1. They want to try out some different learning strategies.

2. They can apply online.

3. They can try taking some subjects that they like.

3417,EAB299C6ECED,"First Impressions are almost impossible to change this is true but they can also slightly change a little bit over time. I personally agree that is almost impossible to change an impression about someone so lets say that I agree and disagree because the statement is right but not everyone is the same, your thoughts and the way you think are different from everyone else, so the way you feel about a person could change over time. The first impression of a person about you could change over time just like your first impression about someone you've never met before could change as time passes and yall get know each other and hang out, go out to eat just like in a relationship, when the girl meets the guy and he looks so handsome, respectful, polite, nice, generous, very responsible from her point of view, when his at school, work, even when his home or even to the point of calling him sexy even if he is the skinniest guy ever you would tell him ""Wow baby, you're so sexy"", even if his not you would say it because you wouldn't want him to feel bad or anything to ruin that bond but when you guys start talking even more, start to hangout more often that bond will start to grow stronger in confidence and trust so when that time hits, It gives us a whole 360 degree spin now you start to be more open with your partner and you actually start saying the real things, Im not saying you have to lie but people in specific try to cover their lies with other lies and some times it dont even work or it don't add up at all but what Im saying is that when that right time actually hits you start being more open and you're not afraid and for the same the reason, you guys develop your ways up and work it out to the point of building a really strong trust, that confidence in you guy's eyes, that key to your heart and let everything be free.

It will take a while for you to see the prove but probably not to long but the results will come at one point and don't doubt it. however, with your first impressions you will represent yourself to the people or the way you act or the way you act in the beginning it will make them know if your child dish, immature, or the opposite.

If you put that respect and honesty in the beginning people will treat you with respect but if you like to mess with people yell at them without respect don't expect something else because it will come back to you and there's this verse in the Bible that I like that says "" what you plant, thats what will grow"" I don't think i wordily got it right how i said so what its meaning is if you're a lair don't be mad or don't ask God why is he doing this to you because that's what you planted in the beginning. When you meet a person what are the first impressions you get of that person on how they look, act and talk. When I first came in Generic_Name class and actually met her, my first impression was she's very nice, knows how to properly talk to students and as time pass I got my points proved right.

I agree with this statement, because the time passes in your life is going with it, the more you do the more you get and that is what people don't get, if you want to make accomplishments in your life you have to worked out man, For example Lebron James how do you think he went where he is now, Making steps in his life, goals, family help, you have all of it it is right there you just have to get it.

""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else""... honestly I will not take it like is changing you, because you are the one changing your life, yes you will be seeing stuffs you will make some errors but that is how you are going to reach what you want in life. you are going easy you will get it easy and you will get it shipper too, if you work hard at the first time, at the end it will come easy and you will be thanks full.

I can be a example for this, I used to hate school a lot, i went tot his time that i didn't wanna even go there, but there was this English 10 teacher that just speaking with me one day just one day, yes I was having F at that moment, after all that thinking a lot about what she said I passed her class at the end with a B, not knowing that I was going to be able to do it, but I did it just doing what i have to do, like I said people can just tell you where is the door you have to go get it.

Student will get to explore certain work area and what type of work they want to do. If student want to work at a company they can visit the company and see what kind of work they do. If school partnership with companies it will help many students to choose what type of work interest them. I think they should select me because I like to be around people, I want to know what type of jobs I want to do, and I want to have a experiment about jobs.

There are so many people who don't like to be around, but I really like to be around people. I think when I am around people It give you a postive feeling. Anywhere you work or go and your around people It alway give you postive feeling. If you work in a company there will be people that you have to work with even if you like them or don't. One time at my school we were in a group project and I didn't know the people who were in the group and I didn't know what to say. Then I started talking to them and now we are friends. Whenever I am around people even If I don't know them and when I start talking to them I feel like I know them for long time.

So many student alreadys know what they want to do in future, but I don't know yet what should I do. I always ask myself that what I am good at. I never figure it out what is something I am good at. I think not someone can get the jobs they want ,but If they select me to It will give me the opportunities to find out what types of work I am interesting in. It will really help me If I know what work I want to do. There are many people who are not happy with their jobs, but they still have to do it for their family. I think people should choose what jobs they want to do.

If I want to work at a company and I don't know anything about the company how can I work there. I think before you work you should have a experiment so you know what is the jobs about. I wanted to work at a resturants, but I didn't know what kind of work will they have so I ask my friend who have work there. If you don't have experiment you can research about it. There are work where you don't have to have experiment, but in some jobs they want you to have a experiment. I always wanted to be a nurse so I always wanted to learn about nursing. If I get select I would have a opportunities to explore about nurse and I will get to have a experiment.

2246,A828480AA508,"Successes comes in so many diffrent whays,but the real questchon is how can having a good attitude lead you to being more successesful in life. I think that starts with your attitude ,attitude plays a big part in your life, for example if your about to take a really big test in math class and you tell yourself befor the teast that your going to fail and your just having a negtive attitude about it, your more likely to fail ,but if you walk into math class with a good attitude and your cofdent in yourself and your just going to give it your beast I thinkyour more likely to pass the teast.

When you think of successes you think of famos people you might think of a person on tv or someone that hass lots of money. If you think about it the people you wach on tv or any of the people you think are successesful hade to have strugled in life to get to the place they are now. What ever the strugle was they hade to get back up and push themself. There are successesful people every where fot example it could be your mom, or your dad, brother, sister any one you know. Successes doesnt have to be a big thing it could be you doing something like running a mile or being the first person in your familly to go to college or just geting all As in school Whatever it is having a good attitude in life can really change your life.

I try to be as successesful as I can if thats in school I try my beast,Whatever it is I know I cant acomlish anything without a good attitude. For example in the fuetre I want to be a fashon disinor, but that whount hapen for years but thers things I can do to push myself to the thing I want to do. Things I can do now to get to my futer ,I can start with a postive attitude There are hatters every where that try to bring you down you just have to learn how to ignore them and learn how to creat a path for yourself.",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.0,2.5,0

Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it.'Do we choose our own character traits ,or is our character formed by influences beyond our control.

Although some people think that character is formed for other persons that are around them and that their character is always going to be formed for people around them but character is formed by the way of your own emotions that shows how you feel how you are, other people says that if they don't be like other people want to they be they feel out of the group in that moment some people starts to hate their self, but what other people do is they ignore what people says about them as they don't hear anything and never give up.

Other people think that if they don't change their character they are going to success in their life and that they are obligate to change for they future and when they change they start to feel bad because they change something better than what they get and when other people ask them for what they change they says that for be an adult they have to be like one but what is a adult is a is a person that looks death and is always mad with other people or they say that the character is formed from the moment they born and that hey can not do anything about it .

In my conclusion, We choose our own character and it's doesn't have nothing with others person ,we choose how we wanna be and how we feel better with our self...

These days happen and it's sometimes gonna be annoying and one thing can not ruin your day. Their could be a day that you get a good grade on your test and you feel happy for yourself, but then you still have a bad grade. People always have some smile in there face and the other people think that their having a good day which they are, but in the inside you don't know what happen.

There are some people that make other people days. Some people have feelings for other people and they get sad when they have a good day, but then they have a test to do which they don't wannna do. Their are even dogs that make people days, but they still think about the difficult time that they had today. People forget what their doing but then remebers what happen. Difficult time happens and you can't help It only If have a good attitude.

Their are sometimes that people have a great day but at the end something bad happens and there were your day is bad. Sometimes people don't like difficult time like stressing out, had a fight, got caught doing bad things, but they still smile becasue there trying to forget about that and think about something better.

I am tired to use all this drogas, i want to be something else in my life. Since this moment he chenged his life. Now he wanna be a doctor for to help people to become a some else in their life. I am agree with Emerson's statement about individuality because i can demostrate that they said is wrong, to show them what is defference between to make and to talk, and to be concetrate. Those thing i can show the people that i can doing with myself and that make me a greatest accomplishment.

I feel to be myself, it is not depend what people said about me. If i want to change or to be something else in a world, i have to do what my mind say to me, for example if i wanna be a teacher. And they tell me to be a teacher is not important because their payment is trash, they just can earn $1000 each months. But if i like to be teacher do not matter what i earn. They will trying to make me confuse. Maybe they already tried it, but they could not do it , that is why they believe that i could not do it either but not all time is the same, the world change every day so i need to try to show them that what they said it, it was wrong. So it is important do not pay attention people who try to make me confuse.

Also there are two defference between to make and to talk because i can believe in myself but if i just talk and to say i will do this, i will do that and i will not doing nothing. That way i can help the world even i lie myself. But if i did not said none and to show people that i change my life with my attitude. they will come at me and ask me what happend with me? because i am changing. I will tell them that i want to be something else in a world. That will be my greatest accomplishment.

Even if i believe in myself i need to be concentrate because i am human and i am not perfect, i can fail with my decision if i am not concetrate. Because bad people will like to see me on ground they will tell something fun that i missing. For example to study, many people do not like to study because they say that school is boring so that i am doing they believe that is boring. They will try to convence me doing wrong things so i have to demostrate them that i wanna be something else in a world not just have fun.

In conclusion, work individuality is not easy i have

To showto the people that sometime we do not need help from somebody else. Just believe in myself, do not heard what they said about me, to show them what is the defference between to make then to talk and all time to be concentration in what i am doing.

Being enspired by someone to do that instrumet or what ever you want to do you need somone to motivate you for example, their was this one time where my brother motivated me to play the chello and I did and it felt good,because I practiced everydaycand I loved doing it. Thats why practicing is important.

Having fun while playing in band or orchestra your able to travel to diffrent states to learn how difrrent groups play,

learn diffrent songs, and learn the sites of that certain city. Thats why I joined orchestra when I was about 9-10years old I learned about 20 new songs that 1 school year and I loved doing it. It was fun to watch, and hear them while playig it was probably the best year i had in 3rd grade.

The people in your group are like your family you guys are going to travel together and perform together. And even making freinds to the new kids who join later in the year so dont worry about being left out while traveling to that certain state your always going have someone to talk to be around.

1157,5985EA6F171A,"I think is a good idea that the students start thinking about what they want to study in the college, what they want to be in the life, and they start preparing for the future in the high school. It is a good idea because they can start working when they are really young, It is a good idea too because they can make money when they are young, It is a good idea because they can buy they own things with their own money, like a house, a car, or whatever they want, and they can get graduate really young and that is the way to prepare you for something.

For example you can stop living with your family you can be indepent, nobody can tell you anything you can rent your own room just for you and you can have your own space, another example is that you are young maybe you make a wrong decision in the career that you choose but the good option is that you are young you already did the high school maybe you already work so you have money you can start another career more important something that these time you already liked because you are more older you know more about what you really want. Also in the work that you have you can study a little bit more and you can scale to another position too much better when you are young you're body don't feel so tired when you work because you have more energy, but when you are more older your body start feel tired, you start loose energy the sickness come your body hurt you have to go more to the doctor, so when you are young you can work more for you retirement.

In conclusion is a good idea that the students start commit a career at a young age because that are going to help them to be someone in the life, also that are gonna help them to be an important person. But the more important is that you are going to work in what do you love to do. The benefit of start preparing for a career since the high school is that you are going to be a young with a lot experience, also that help to the young students stop thinking on bad things, like cigar, tobacco, alcohol etc. Also help them keep their mind busy and to be in high school and not in the streets with bad friends that help them to keep a educational way. And is something that they are going to use in the life and is something that is good, what we need now is a societies based on education because that is a good thing because the education come with a lot of opportunities and with that opportunities the students can lear a lot, the learning is the best thing on the world.",2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,0

Students who commit to a career at a young age always doing better things in them life, and when students get a old age he or her always know what they have to do because they trust their work when they was young.

Ex: Generic_Name said, when she was a young, she was trust her things and it was always teaching her many thing and shows her what to do and how to be, and many people was care about her, they was not doing them things without her, when they want to do their things, they was waiting her because she was help them and teaching their, and she get an achievement in her life, and reach her goal.

2267,A9A6B5A288DC,"Should some people believe in praising a student's work to build self-esteem, even if the work is not the student's best effort. They believe that students must be self-confident in order to learn. I agree with students must be self confident because its better to grow in life then stay in the same place over and over again. If a student does not believe in what he or she can do then that student will not be able to compete things in that student's life time. Also a builds a great mindset for the student to keep moving forward. Students should have self-esteem for a successful life.

If a student doesn't believe in what he or she can do then that student will not be able to compete things in that student's life time. Student that doesn't think that their capable of doing more that student will stay the same and would not be able to grow, also that student self-esteem will lower down. Another thing a student should getting moving up and high than he or she can do is there are no limits in what that person can do if the student knows that they would be able to do what they can do they can easily grow by practicing more and believing they can do it. So by not believing in what he or she can do that will affect what will happen later in life, never stop believing in what he or she can do as a student.

Building a great mindset for the student to keep moving forward. To have a good self-esteem the student will have to set up goals to show to their self that that student can do more. Another thing after writing down their goals is which one will they do first or which one is do he or she want to compete first. With all the choices to choose like for example: goals, friends or family that support, or how will is the student want to succeed, because even if they don't try as hard as they know how to it could happen to anyone in life that shouldn't make a student to stop trying it should make them feel like okay it wasn't my best my first time he or she can get the second time because a student should always chase what they are willing to have. Building a great mindset for the student to keep moving forward is good for a student to have a great self-esteem. The reason students should be praising for their self-esteem is, because no students should say no to even if it's not their best work the first time everyone should have a chance to have a great self-esteem and to keep growing in life.",2.5,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.5,2.4,0

If the curfew adopt the teenagers, the situation will change to the better. the council said the teenagers don't have to be in the street after 10 p. m. in the weekdays because they want the teenagers out of troubles. and they found teenagers in the street after 10 P.M. that's mean is breaking the law. that warning for the people because sometimes the bad people walk around have a knife or have a gun these people can kill someone kidnapping anyone. Or someone make a bomb and try to put it in street. and also is danger because maybe someone drank a lot and he drove the car maybe can hit anybody by the car that's why the police check the city a lot of time to make sure no bad things will happen and also the police check the city because if someone have something wrong they will help them. if the teenagers don't break the law this will help the police to try make the city safe the safety in city is so important. Like example that happen with me when I was 15 years old I was walking in the street at 11 p. m. and I was going to my home I see one man behind me but I thought is regular man but he was have a knife and he said to me give anything you have I was have my wallet had on it my ID and not too much money and I don't have anyone in the street to help me and he took my phone and he told me leave and don't look behind you I ran away because he was almost gonna kill me. be in your home early to be safe. The police doesn't want to control on you but he want to be safely. because the world is not safe now the world have a lot of bad people. And also I was have my friend was in street at 1 a. m. and someone was drank and hit my friend by the car. And my friend is dead all of these to show you how the world is not safe. the police have a lot of situations with the bad people. and if you look at the countries is not safe the reason is because every day around the country you will find everyday someone killed. That's tells you how the world is not safe. a lot of people dead because of the people is drank or the someone have a gun or knife. if you search in internet about the people is succeed in their life the internet will show you these people focused in their future when they finish their work the going to their home to take a rest. try to make your schedule early like in the mid day in the morning to go to your home early.

Wilnston churchill, he say that success in life or anyother things, theres a failure and don't lose enthusiasm because of that litlle things or because you fail one time in your try.

I agree with the minister churchill say because succsee it's a way to improve your skills or be betther in what you did and you try to not haves more make mistakes annymore, success can have failure but also you can lern for them, and learn how to rersolve your pronlemsand see how far you can go by trying, how you can have more expiriense by traying and traying again and again, no making mistakes annymore so the next time you don't have the same mistakes or pronblems because you larn about it.

I think with success you can learn a lot of experiance in your life, because with your failure you learn about it, because if you leave it like that you not trying and you are not exploing your self, so if you exploit your self you can see how far you can go to resolve the problems or the mistake you have.

So if you explod your self trying more and more you can maybe resolve the problem or see how far you can go to find a solution, the thing is if you keep trying your best in somthing you don't know exacly what it is or how to resolve it in many times you can find a solution and fix it.

failure is not you are not going to resolve it because if you are doing your best but you keep failure is becuase you need to find the problem you are not seeing, to resolve it failuture is not because is not working success is because you didn't find the solution at your problem.

For my conclusion for success you have to pass for a lot of problems and mistakes so you can find a solution for it, in your life if you don't explow your self you won't know what was the problem to that but if you explow your self you can find the solution and also learn from that, trying hard and hard moust of the times you can find a solution for evryting and that is how you also you can help others with they problems like when they say two heads is better then one.",2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.2,0
2253,A8D0ADC676C0,"Everyone would eventually ask an advice if they need help on a particular subject or ask for an opinion if they ever get confuse. Advises or opinions would solve one's problem. For example, to prevent making poor choices or decisions, to determine which advice is accurate, and to allow someone to feel secure with choices. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.

First, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice by preventing making poor choices or decisions. For instant, if someone attempts to steal. If there's something you want but it's expensive. Also, if someone gets in a fight. If there's someone you don't like or disagree with. Lastly, if someone lies. When someone did something wrong and lied about it. Seeking multiple opinions can help some make a better choice.

Furthermore, seeking multiple opinions can help people make a better choice by determining which advice is accurate. For example, to be sure that it's reliable. If many said the same thing while others said a different thing. Also,if someone wasn't sure about the advice. Ask people for more advice if the advice is inaccurate. Lastly, if the advice is inaccurate. If someone said one thing while others said the other thing. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.

Finally, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice by allowing someone to feel secure with choices. For instant, if someone gets confuse. If you're lost on one subject. Also, if someone gets lonely. if someone doesn't have a baseball team. Lastly, if someone gets worried or afraid. If someone you know is absent or gone. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.

In summary, viewing many opinions can benefit people to make a better choice by preventing making poor choices or decisions, determining which advice is accurate, and by allowing someone to feel secure with choices. I believe that asking yourself for advice is also necessary. but, viewing many opinions from people is probably more necessary than viewing your own advice.",2.0,2.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.3,0

When you constantly trying to make you something you learn something that you don't know; something that surprise you because you never think that you can do, and you say I can do that thing and I want to experiment more things spontaneous because is better when that things have spontaneous because left better and so cool and impressive to you. Experiment more things new help you to be better every moment, to that these for you can helped an others persons when they need our help, when meet with one situation where somebody need help motivate that he or she can do it nothing is impossible, because a lot of peoples in the world don't believe in their self because all that time suffrage bullying they thing that they don't serve for nothing they believe in that bad words, is for these reasons that one situation appear in front of our eyes helped, spoke with love,respect,be courteous because when you spoke with one persons that have these problems where suffrage bullying, bad words that others peoples say they feel miserable have hatred,resentment and all of times they don't want to talk, you need or our need to going to these peoples and spoke with love, love is one of the most good gun that we have is the most important in that around world.

The first reason is the older students give a advise to the younger students, the older student are helping with the younger students because when the older student are giving advise to the younger student make them intelligent for example when i was in elementary school in fifth grade my principle asked my teacher to give information or to give idea to the third grader on their project and my teacher sand us to the third grade classroom and my classmate was helping with the third graders.

The second reason is to help them make more understandable on their subject, the older students are trying to make the younger students more knowledgeable in their subject. for example when i was in sixth grade the my best friend was in seventh grade when i needed help with my homework or with same other classes homework and she was always helped me with my homework, testes, and quizzes and i was getting more understandable in my every subjects and she teached me how to solved problems.

My Teacher Wanted me to Share a Lesson With Elementary Students

.

Next, I told The Students, What I was going to present to Them. it's very Important to Speak With The Students About Something interested That They Would Love, to hear About. I told The Students What They Want to be when they grow up, They said I

Want to be a Police Officer one Day. The other one said He Wanted to be a fighter fighter. And I told Them to Become a police officer or a Fighter Fighter They need to graduate high School And Get a Degree For College And Take Those Classes, to have a Good Job for The Rest of Their life's. Finally When My Presentation Was Almost over Suddenly' The Students Ask me Those That I'm going to Take Do I have to Past Those Certain Classes to Get my Degree, Also I Said it's Not That Easy to Have Your Dream Job That You Want. You Have to Work For it And Earn it And Try Everything You Could We're You Want to Be. Motivate Your Self, Push Your Self If You want Your Career that you want Then, Always Believe in Your Self When You Have a Dream Career Don't Give up on it. When You Give up on Something You're Not Going To succeed in Life. I'll Tell My Self To Get Back Up On Your Feet And Chase Your Dream. But in Life there's No Second Chance. Last, When You Finally Acheive Your Dream Job You Can Thank Your Self for Believing in Your Self and Working, Hard every day. because After All The Struggle, You Been Putting Your Self to Succeed And That's Why you Are We're at And Always Chase Your Goals to Succeed.",3.0,2.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.5,0

First i want to be something in the the future i will choose my won character, second i will choose my won character to be socialize with people and third i might chose my won character to take care of my health.

First i want to be something in the the future i will chose my won character. For example; my parents wants me to follow what they wants to make my character but i'm not agree with their decision, they wants me to be a doctor in the future but, i want to be a pilot in the future, so i will decide my won character to be a doctor or a pilot and i would choose what is best for me.

Second i will choose my won character to be socialize with people. For instant; I love people! spending time with people around me helping me to learn how to build my won character better, being socialize with people mean you have more friends and spending time with them can help me to learn new things from them and experience them might help my won character.

Third i might choose my won character to take care of my health. whoever health is more important to me, health is depend on my won character ,for example; if i eat healthy food it's can help my mind to think about my won character, if my health is not good i won't be able to follow my won character so, we should focus more about our health,so we can be able to choose our won character in conclusion, it is true that your character will be what you yourself choose to make it. i want to be a pilot in the the future i will chose my won character,spending time with people around me helping me to learn how to build my won character better and if my health is not good i won't be able to follow my won character.

94,06FA8EF28227,"Many people in the history of the world were important because they become who they want to be, and now society try to persuade people from who they are and change to what they want, to be your self in a world that is constantly traying to make you something else is the gratest accomplishment, also you decide who you want to be

I agree with this because some times parents try to change their children, also school making decision for their students, religion first point parents trying to change their children, in some cases parents try to persuade their children from what they want to do or from what they want to be on the future, if some one of their children want to play soccer and if their parents do not know everything about soccer they search anything they just say no and they make their children to try something different or if the child do not want to go the place that they are going most of the parents do not listen what their sons want or like and also sometimes parents make their children to be what they do not what to be in some cases parents tell they children that they need to play an instrument liket the guitar but maybe that child wants to play the drums. some famous people are unhappy because their parents make them to become famous but maybe that child do not want to do that.

second point some times school makes decision for students too some times students do not want to take some classes and school choose for them, in some parts students do not like to wear uniforms and they make them to wear it, in case that you came from other country and you do not speak the same language you need to be able to learn because if you did not do it you are not able to be in the school and if you do not understand what are they talking about is hard but you need to be like them because you do not have people who speak the same language as you do, so you have to be part of something even if you do not like it third point religion is there to try to change your mind they are many religions in the world but all depends if you want to choose one of those religions but some times people try to make you part of that religion and some times you change completly of who you was if that work for you is perfect but if not you are going to be completly different person, you need to dress different at you usual do, and also they tell you what is wrong and what is not wrong even if you did not do anything wrong they think that and they always want you to belieb things that maybe are not true but why we need to follow that and why we need to beliebe that, so if you want to do something do that thing because you want it not because someone tells you.

In my opinion I agree with what Albert Emerson wrote because to be our self in this world that is constantly traying to make us something else is the greatest accomplishment, is hard to be our selfs because people are always traying to tell us about what we are going to do because for the society what they do is good but maybe you have a different idea but most of the time you need to do what they tell you to do the best accomplishment is being ypour self and being what you want to be and if you want to do something just do it and do not listen about what other people say or what they think because people are never happy with the things that you do.

161,0C30A2A5D998,"It success consists of going from failure? I think that there are people that are successful and have gone through failure because without experiences people will not know that is out there. I believe that in live there is gong to be up and down and this teach us who to be an successful person.

First,to have a successful live we need the experience to be success not matter who many obstacle we have. When I was eleven I star making cookies at first I was bad, and when I fail the first try, but I keep going to make cookies not matter how bad I was. Then as I keep failing, and one day I was able to be successful. People have to know that we are not perfect and in some point of live we have to be unsuccessful to became what we one to be some day, Also it very important that people have the capability to say that they have make mistake.

Second,people have up and downs. As an example J.K Rowling she wrote the Harry Potter sires,and she want it to published,but she was not successful,and then by the time her sires was one of the most famous book. I believe that any one can be an successful person,but they have to know that not every thing is going to be a success at the first try.

Other believe that success is not consisted in failure because they think that people can be successful with out making any mistake. Thinking that every thing is easy as an litter kids puzzle.

In conclusion failure is one step of been success because every person can process the piece that their missing to be successful. As people have been going in up and down,and had experiences who thing are going.",3.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.5,2.5,0

So you don't think that to be mistaken is wrong, but if you make a mistake, try to don't do it again. I give you a example: If you are on a game (football,soccer,basquetball,etc), so if you are on any game and your time is lose, but you know the wron in the other team, so you know that you can attack on this wron and you can won the game, or if you lose that game but you got the revenge, well now you know where is the wrong and maybe your team won the game.

here are reason why they should be achievement .

achievement for student more hard working than praising student . for example let say you are try to work very hard if the teacher praised to student the student going to give up the work or get so upset . student needs achievement to more work done.

praising is not a bad thing. so this is why people should pick an achievement .

let say you wanna make students to do some project for about how to draw an art . if one of them succeed on their project and other one praising him it will not make sense for them . but if you active them that will be their for history of their school years.

and lastly achieving the student makes them more happier than praising the student . because may the get high points or good grade (A or B) or better than praising the student .i should say self-esteem comes from achievement .

Also students help their parents taking care of their sibling after school, some times also students help their parents at home as clean the floor, wash dishes, make dinner and time for their hobbies, made the life of the students more easy at schools and at home.

students that like to do sports after school as soccer, fotbool, basquelbal, or tennis, some just wants to have a little time of peace by themselves as reading or walking alone those little thing is what a student can miss but if teachers decide to extended the schools to hours late, students also are going to work the same amount of time the only different is that they have to work to hour more each day to complete the forty hours work for week, and those two hours would private students to do what they like to do and make the life more happy.

The other companies can check the books and the games in the large screen because they builded the large screen with their technology and they can speaking with other person and it's important to help to the person with their comunication because we need to learning about to the new tehnology that they builded and the employee need to brings good ideas for the boss for to do the games more better with the new technology.

with the other technology new they can show the books in the other companies and they need to do activite with the other employee then the need to have good life and they need to do vacation for relax for that have good ideas the employee to have access for get more better the games because they want to build good games for the persons the employee need get something that can they to do idea they can work with the other person that they can to do good work.",2.0,2.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,3.0,2.4,0

I disagree imagination is more important that knowledge.

I disagree because, I think knowledge it's more important because, you have to knowledge after you imagine because, I think knowledge it'a more important because you have to knowledge. The situation to think really good if you dont due you can not think what it's gonna happen.

because if you only imagine you don't gonna knowledge good because, if you only imajinate and say the words after you knowledge the words you what to says. and if you knowledge first after think you can be able to due son tings.

If you gonna to due a story if you only imagine you can not be able to due because you have to Knowles the situation first after you think because son times you can get good imagination and you have to knowledge.

like for example if don't knowledge you don't gonna now were put tings to knowledge the situation were you gonna put things and the ca n be better.

I don't no what scientists Albert Einstein think and i gonna now what he thinks because, people have different opinion like how it's more better to they can use, and because persons have different ideas,like me i think then knowledge it's more important, then imagination but others people they can think it'snot because for people to see things it's different, because if the person am gonna write the story am gonna use the knowledge to knowledge, the situation better and make good story.

The knowledge it's like then a group because you have to search or knowledge to now what you gonna due because, if you only have in a imagination to what you gonna due that can work, like when you go to your job and you have to knowledge,what you gonna due for the day.

when you go to school and you go to science if you have to examine the a plant you have to knowledge the plant to now were you can star to examine the plant.

when you due sometimes you have to knowledge the situation,like for example,when a person quilled to another person, the police they have to knowledge,the scene and who was the criminal and knowledge the situation how died and who was .

some people think the imagination it's was first and it's more important would, I think the people see for different forms to due would a think some people it's right because, I see for different forms like when you imajinate it's like when you imajinate the things would you can have a picture in your minds like you can see pictures like were you what to put things.

but you can have im imajine in your mied but you have to knowledge first because i think if you knowleged because i feel more necesary to knowleged beause when you knowledged you can feel it's more easy or if you look like the pictures way it's more easy, because you see the things more specific en your miend.

it's alot ways to you can see things because for people some people looks diferets to others you can see more better in you way if you don't get.

First, the students has more distraction in home; with vedeo play, and othe oction, more students work a time with taking a class, more with have a classes in distance, the schools need a tanking a other options. With lern in school the students are more specific learn, with a have a teacher opposite the student to learnig more specific, when she tanking the classes to has a more effective for a students.

Second, I hink this option for learning offer the class in distance wich a attend classes from home; not is a good option for example: in my house a have three brothers, and one sister, I think is distraction wich learning in home.

In finally; with reason with not is good idea the learning a distance the school, I think is more elementary, basic to taking the video conferencing online, because; learning more in the watch the vedeo conference, with online; is more effective memorize with the morning in not in evening, the students have forceful in the morning, but no think this is a good option for a students, not have a good benefit from being able to attend classes from home.

If your school extend school day for two hours there are some thing you can't do. You can't play after school games. You can't do your homework. You have less time to work. You going home late. You can't fresh your mind.

Reason one, students who work after school they have moer time on work. For example, if your working time is four o'clock to ten o'clock. If you work regular time you going to make more money. Students need to work becaus they needs to pay the cell phome bills or on gasolin.

Reason two, students who want to play after school game they can play the game. If they don't have time to play after school game they can't fresh there mind. For example, students who live one or two hours away for school they have time to play after school game.

Reason three, students can fresh there mind. Students can't fresh there mind because they are studying more then they need. For example, some time students can't remember what they learn in class, but can do other thinks. Some time student haveing so much fun in the class. Because there mind is so much fresh.

some reasons why they should know more aobut a career at younger age are:

They will be ready after they graduate and know'ing what are they gonna do.

It will be more easy after you graduate you don't have to worry about what career are you gonna study,

and it ognna make you more responsible.

Some students don't like this idea to be guide at a younger age they don't want to worry that much,

some student just want to finish high school firts and they have 4 years to decide what are they gonnna do after high school and what career are they gonna pick.

3674,F65622698950,"Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing""?

I believe, when most of the people don't understand how relevant is to do something instead of being inactivity that also serve purpose because like everybody else it is normal to always do or make good things for someone, and it could be family or close friends for example.

My reason is if we try to done good stuff for people, and not receiving anything back for example: If I give people chance to not try anything, then how are we gonna communicate? how are we going to accomplish our goal when you don't deserve it? so my point and my reason is the we need to do something about not being inactivity with people are around you. I understand that not everyone are gonna have the same thoughts as me or with other person. However we need to be on the side to the change for good.

I grew up knowing when people put a lot of their afford to you, it means a lot because you'll never know when people will trust you and believe in you again it's a huge difference between those, and we people show us or make us see how important is when almost everything is easy when we ask for it example: Trying to hard to show how many things you have done for that person without asking, but it means a lot to you because you give a lot to that person and you hope that person can give you the same thing you've done for her or him.

Sometimes some people misunderstood about always doing something for her or him like you don't have to do it for them, but believe you'll feel great if someone do something for you isn't a bad thing then you will be fine and grateful knowing that theres good people around you, and ready for help you. You ain't alone anymore believe theres people for you and try to not think too much about it.

My conclusion is about to always do something for people because there is people who will need you, and being around, and everything you want to do for them it will make it better like. Thomas Jefferson wanted to do good stuff as a president caring about his people, and making him one of the best presidents, so it is wonderful to done much for them than yourself.

Having a specific career while being young student would make the student more responsible and creative of what he is going to do for his life with full of confidence, because in growing up more hard decisions the student will have so he has to choose the right decision, being creative at his career will let the student get a big succeed, and being already chosen a career is enough by itself to stay away of the people who failed in their life because they dont have a goal or career they can get.

2286,AAE16C990870,"To begin with, I am going to be listing my reasons on why i agree to the statement that the former British prime minister winston churchill said. In each paragraph I will be supporting my reasons.

To start off with, My first reason on why i agree with the statement Is because their Is always a saying that says keep trying don't give up. When i read this statement I see that saying because you can't give up you got to keep trying to get what you want.

Second, With the statement saying ""success consitts of going from failture to failture' I agree with just for the smiple fact that In life you will go through some rough times and you may not always succeed In what you are trying to do or accomplish, because someone will always fail at something they are trying to accomplish but will keep trying because at some point they will complete what they had tried to accomplish the whole time.

Last, Someone can't lose hope of trying to complete something because they will complete it. They have to stay motivated to keep on going and keep on going to complete it. Everyone will be successful but If someone just gives up and doesn't keep trying then they won't get what they wanted to accomplish. Some people don't know that enable to succeed they will fail at it plenty of times but they would have to keep trying to succeed at it and can't lose hope.",2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,0

In my opinion I think it would be great for the health of the school and student to have a healthy food during school hours, one main reason is bacause it keep our body,healthy strong in which we can reflex our education, It will benefit all the students mainly the ones that are in PE class,eating healthy can improves more day of life and better human body, eathing halthy can prevent you from disease and probably some virus.

by eathing healthy you will not only will be able to be on a good fit you can also feel good and with feeling good about your self means more thant anything in this world, my opinion about this i agree with this change and i would like to see more plans for the upcoming futre years.

every plas have good and bad opinions many student at school have said and have their own opinion, Many of them dont like to eat halthy they just wnat to eat and enjoy their life at the fullest, which is reasenable and i undestand they point, we all know that the food that make our body get fat and get worse is the bad type food but we all love that kind of food, is delicius and it taste great for example pizza, hamburgers and all those kidn of food.

To keep a balance and for the students to be better and feel better about them self i think it will be the best to have a schedule of food for example :monday healthy food, Tuesday bad food...

In my opinon i thik it will be the best for our students and for everyone in the school to have a healthy food schedule that way we can be happy and satisfy with our body. I agree with the plan of replacing the school food for a healthy kind of food. thanks for all your pation and i hope you like my opinions and you could consider this on your future plans.",2.0,2.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,3.0,2.4,0
2730,C8EBB096262B,"To Begin with, many student have many excuses to not attend school. Of curse, that we can change this to not be happen anymore. Student may not complete the school if they lose the year.

What would happen if student get affected for all student that not attend school? For example, like I seen in me that I have a lot of appointment that is affecting me and my grade. We can not let this happen we need to do many thing in order to not let our child lose. In addition,

principal should offer distance learning for student that the way could not affect them because student might have a natural disaster in their neighborhood, student might be sick in such manner that could not attend school, that might affect their grade and they might repeat the year.

First reason, student might be absent for a reason like to be sick in such manner that could not attend school. All included student that is special that they go for a week or more in the hospital. Moreover, student sometime the doctor let a lot of appointment for them to check up or appointment with the dentist. Also, student who have allergies when the weather change they got affect in that they may not come to school. In high school, student sometime they get pregnant and the doctor let them many appointment including when they delivery they lose many school days and that affect many student lose the year or they may get affect their grade. Because we don't know in the future what will happen to some of our student that many of them don't find any solution of their problem. In fact, we don't know what it will happen if we don't give an opportunity to our students. We must pay attention to them if they lose many days of school sometime they are afraid to talk about their problem.

Second reason, student in their neighborhood might have a natural disaster also might need the distance learning in order to not lose school days. Sometime the weather get so angry that may bring accident or can bring tree crashing in our hose or may get rain and rain that could bring floating that may cause a lot of problem to some our students. In addition, the school bus may not get as in order to come to school. If it a student that walk that student could not get to school and the County could not cancel the school or even in there's no light and that may tell an announcement that student could not get informed about the school information weather. Because, if student get that problem the principal could not believe and it can not give an chance to those student to take the test or the exam that they had in class. After all, in the school no one care about you even if you have a teacher that it is so inpatient.

To end with, the school should offer the distance learning to some of our students. Student may got sick for a little reason and if they had natural disaster, we should care about it. If we find a student that always is absent we should ask them what is the matter or what is the problem with them? While some may argue that if we offer the distance learning student may not lose school days and even they could not lose their grade student could have benefit from this way student could not lose, however some may argue that if we gave the distance learning to student student could not enjoy this learning they just will playing even if we give the distance learning in computer they just see it they they will start playing video game or they just will watch a video.

i think some of student want to go help the community and some of them didn't want to help the community but i think that student should perform community service because we not let down the student who wants to go and help the community because if u say the student will not perform community some of student will think that this is unfair and they will not agree with this decision. all i have to say is that student should perform community. have a great decision and also thank you.",2.5,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.5,2.4,0
3103,DBDE16551908,"I think the best way is to work as a group. You might ask why. is the best way students get to learn, For example; I'm the type of student that like to hear about peoples opinion. By listining to other people opinin give the other student a idea on how the project or the assigment should be done. When student get the chance to express they idea they feel confident no fear to express themselve.

Many students like to work bby themselve, therefore no other student interrupt the by asking to many question. Most of them already have a topic to talk about they already have a plan. For Example student that work alone they mostly working at their own pace, working alone give then the chance of finishing on time.

Working as a group give the student the chance of dividing the work in different sections, For example; this student would do this part, the pther student would design the project, the other student would do the research. Dividing the project in different part let the student look or choose the part the thing is easy to do ot they know how to do it already.

Student get to meet new people, by doing a project like a group student somtime don't get to choose who they work with, The profesor might give the students a group of people they never meet before. working as a group with new people let you find a new ways to work or write. For example you meet this new student who make a T chart and write the good about this topic and the negative side about the topic next to it. After looking at it he decide what side he should talk about.

You get things done a lot faster by doing in groups as I said before working with a group let the work get done a lot faster, it's give the people the chance of focusing and the part they have to get done. If you finish your part of the project or assigment, you can volunteer to help other team mate. For example someone that works by themselve might need more time, because she's working by her self and you get the chance to volunteer to help her out on something, she might found difficult to do.

In my conclusion, working like a group it teach the students to listen to other peoples thoughts and, it's the best way students work as one. But other peolpe would say that working alone is the best choice, because it teach the student how to make decision on their own and how they should write their own paper with anybody helping them out.

2367,AFC600D922F6,"I agree because being yourself is very hard sometimes and feel a lonely. Today is in the world nobody like to be all by themselves but some people like to be themselves. If you being yourself you can able to do more work because nothing else to do and feel like board so let study something, work hard. How about your fun time go out with someone, you can't be work hard all the time because that is not a good experience. So I do sometime fun myself and be yourself It's doesn't means you can do any a good stuff. You can do something what is make you feel a happy all your life. don't feel strange yourself and being strong.

First, I like be myself sometime because that make me bring my own idea and also help me figure our myself. What is a good thing or what is a bad thing for me. That make me strong because I using my own bring and think twice myself before I do something. My first year was be American be myself without Family, I feel very sad, and I sad to myself I never want to be myself my life again. I want to go back where are I am came From, I don't want to be in American anymore because know language very important for me that time. I don't understand any English that time and I don't have any Friends. I still remember how hard the was being yourself and I never knew be yourself Will be that hard, Now I know.

Second, after couple years I make my own choose I wan to be myself but no more sadness. So what I did was no looked what other people do and people I ignore with Friends they're all together or family because that make me sad. I could't told you how bad that feel was for me and I relax everything will be fine, I take deep bread. Now I don't worry about be myself anymore because now I know that wasn't that bad after you use to and also, infect that make me a little bit more independent.

Third, Now I responsibility everything myself and be myself that make me diff rant. My last year was raft because my faster Family said to me you have to learn do stuff by yourself. I am so norvise because I can't do anything whiteout them so I have to learn be myself before turn eighteen.

3427,EB1500B8EA75,"Some students who live far away from their schools; they prefer to attend classes from their home instead of going to a school, attending classes from their home can affect some students education and affect their live in a future beacuse not all of the students who are taking online classes are going to complete their work .In my opinion I think is a bad idea to attend classes from your home because students can get distracted for anything, not complete their work and get bad grades.

If we have online class it can be hard to these people who got distracted for anything .Once I had a friend her name was Generic_Name, and she had a online math class that she needed to be able to graduated. One day I went to her home like at 6:00 pm after shool and she was working in her online class, but honestly Generic_Name was not really woking in what she suppose to be working on, yes she had her cumputer on and her online class open , but she was getting distracted by the her tv show just because she like the beaty and the best she stop doing her work. My friend Generic_Name she suppose to do her work but she always got distarcted by her tv show, if she had deside to turned off her tv she didn't got distarcted by anything and she could be success in her online class.

Students who attend classes from their home as there is anyone who is reminding them to completen the work some of them forgot to get it done and they had an incomplete work. This year I am taking an online class and sometimes I forget that I have to be doing all my requested assingments, and by the end of last week I got a bad score because i didn't complete my Vocabulary assingment. If I had put a alarm every day to remind me that i have tostudy and complete my asssiments i could get a better score.

Some others will say that attending classes from home can be a good idea because they can work on in any time,however,others may say that is a bad idea beacuse they can get bad grades. Some classmate that are taking online classes they aren't reading all the directions that the class is giving ;they are just doing the work without reading and that can affect their grades. Having bad grades can made you to not pass your school year, but if we efort we can be great.

For some students is consider to take online classes, but in some point can affect them in their education. There are many students who have online classes and they are falling because they dont have enough help, and some of they because they are not doing it .If schools provide after schools help for online classes will be helpful for all student who needed to be more success, and feel more confortable while they are doing their work and also teachers to be cheking if students are able to pass.

For example right now am doing a sol if i aim to high in order to pass and reach 12th grade and to get my diploma my aim can a low and i can still have a achieve my mark .

Everday you do more you learn more, you acomplish more as long as you believe, and have the heart for it .I don't like braging about my self but I am allways doing something. Right now i am 18 and belive it or not i own two busniss. I make good money but it everday is a struggle to keep the busniss runnig good and going to school but i never once thought about stoping here i wana do more i wana be sombody .

Frist, reason why i agree with Thomas jefferson is becuase if your idle you will never make it out i promise here is a example Donald Trump he is one of the richest people in America and he has his own air plane decraded with 24k gold so you know he has accomplished a lot of things he can be retired living in a island right now but right now instead he is the president of united states you know why becuase he is not a idle person he wants to do more like what Ragin(rip to thats mans) said ""dont ask what your country could do for you ask what you can do for your country"" and that is what Donald is doing right now he is doing more and acomplishing more .

also, its okay to be idle some times we humans everydody needs a little break just as long as you believe. And make goals for your self you will be alright.

1496,736E8C8444E6,"Had the technology a negative or positive effects on people's lives? People are having a negative effects with the technology, I think people can't control it. At this time everybody are forgeting how beutiful is lives with out technology. We can do alot of things with out it. For example: Play outside with friends, go to libraries, and stay outside with natural. Some people say the kids have to have limitation of what they doing on they computer or cells phones. On the other side people say that is good for teenager having not limitation because they can learn more. I think teenager need a limitation of what they doing in the phones. Furthermore parents should cheking what they doing in the internet.

However, some people think is good for teenager not having a limitation because they learn more for their future. On the other hand some people say that that tenenager can't complete a taskd with out having contact with other person. I thinbk having a conversition with other is good because you get to know that person and also get stronger the relationship. When you meet a strager in the internet is dangeous, not everyone is a good person. Some parents think that the kids are just playing in the internets but they do not. I think having a conversiation to you or playing games without speaking I think that have a limitation until you know well that person.

In addition, sometimes people used to buy alot of things from the internet without knowing that person, that is dangerous. People that are seeling on wedsides that always offer what the really have or maybe they just want the money. If you going to buy anything for the internet just make sure the wedside is safes. Buying staff for the internet is getting wrong because people do not want to go aout and spend time with family. Since wedsides liike Amazon, Ebay, and others came up people atart get all they need from wedside. Bad people are used this on favor to them, they are creating so many fake wedsides to racket people.

To continue with, I think a good way to get the kid out the technology is take them to have fun outside like hand out with friends, having friends in a computer like into a videogame or a social media is not healty for the kids. You have to get to know the person before play or talk to them. Sometimes people trick the kids ask them to do bad things.

That why technology shoul not be allow for kid at all or if parents decide to give a cells phone or a computer always have to be a limitation.

Technology does not aloww people to complete task with out haave a contact with others. I think this is having a negative effects on people lives, people are getting racket because they used to maney wedsides. Wedsides are not save you have to have a limitation and also take care of the like. Kid are also getting into the technology they are losing their childhooh.

867,42587039161D,"Do you think technology is helpful ? I think Technology allows people to do many stuff and i think its postive because that way if you have to go buy grocery you can just go grocery shopping online something else why i think it is positve is because pepole can also work from home like lets say if you work in a offiice you can use your laptop so that is what i think about this. For example when my sister feels sick or does not have time to go grocery shopping she goes online and she gets her grocery deliverd in front of the house.

Another reason why i think it is postive because lets say if you dont drive and need a ride you can download the app uber and get yourself a ride to go where you would like to go. Another reason is if you need to clothes shopping there is no worries because you can aslo go online and see what you want to buy if you dont have time to go in the store to see what u need you can always go online. something else is you do not have to go to the book store because you can read online and even check out books. you can bisically do everthing online pay your payments so many stuff these are some reasons why i think tecnology has been positve in peoples lives. Also another good reason is my grandma lives in Generic_City and now we can also facetime her from a diffreant country thanks to technology. One reason why it could be negative because if pepole order stuff and dont go out to buy somehting in the store they are not getting enougeh extracise and they are just being really lazy. Another reason why it could be a negative is nowadays pepole dont even talk face to face all they do is either text call stuff like for example when i go over my grandmas house for any holidays my cousins they dont communicate all they do is sit there be on there phones these are some negative reasons.

So these are some reasons why i think technology is positive nowadays. Another good example is when i go to Generic_City or travaling anywhere what my older sister does is she checks us in so that way we dont have to wait in the big line at the airport and we already have our seats picked so that is also a good thing. like i said in the top paragraph in my postion technolgy has been really halpful for pepole. you can really do anything with your phone you can also pay with apple pay if you leave your wallet at home that is something you can do pay with apple pay.

Everyday, when we wake up we need to think about today what is plan we need to finished? do not lazy, many people need dream. One reason, If we attitude to think about what is plan need to finished ,we don't feel boring., we feel a lot power. For example: the students will know next class should be taking the test ,the students plan to study tonight ,they do study guide, more practie during the test they will get good great.

I think your students should have community service but i think its only fair to the people that do something bad to do community service, because for example some of the students at school litter and if they do and you catch them you should make them do community service for littering. not all students should do that only the kids that act up because if you put all the kids in that your gana be taking their time away and its gana be worst there gana get mad.

1759,856351253492,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" Will if you try will you be able to grow more? Does it matter what you eat? What can you do about you height? I disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson because i dont think that you can make yourself taller. He say if you try will it even work? I still think if you try it wont work because the height we have now is because our father in heaven made how we are now.

First, it doesn't matter if you try or not your height and how you look it comes from your parents genes, and it can also come from another family member. I don't think that you can do anything about your height because it depends on your family too. Even if you try you all you can do is to try to have a nice body, but about you height i don't think you could get taller then you already are. The only thing that can change is your body what i mean is if you chubby, over weight you can do excuse so you can have your body the you once wanted to have. If you really skinny you can eat a little bet more, but if you like how your are now you dont have to change anything. But like i always say ""Love yourself and how you look no matter what people say, the only one who could change you is yourself.""

Second, I don't think you can make yourself taller because there is no way that you can become taller then you already are , and don't you think that the really short people will be taller by now then shorter.

I think that they would not like to be short because in this world there is really mean people that will laugh about others, or how they look, and how short they are. So that is why I think that there is no way to make yourself taller.

Don't you think that short people will be short, and be laugh at no they would not like that son that is why i disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson.

In the other hand, it does matter to eat healthy so you can be in shape and you will be in this life longer. Normally you can do anything about your height because trust me if you could i've been taller by now. I don't like to be short because sometimes i get judged by my height, or how i look, and how chubby i am and i would like to have everything perfect like all those ladies and girls in the magazines or in the TV shows, and i would like to be 6 .3 ft tall then 5.3 ft. So yeah they is no way to change how you look , but by fixing yourself like: Appalachians, surge, and other things you understand what i mean right.

So that means that i still disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson because there is no way that people can make them self taller because even short people or person will be the size or shape they will like to be. This world is not that perfect because if it was everything or everyone will be how they world want to be in this world. So that is why i disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson as you can see i give reasons and examples.

This goes to the person that ready's my story please give me a changes to pass just one i have never pass an SOL before and i will be really happy if you could pass me just once in my life. On this one i have tried my really best so you could understand me what am talking about.

So please please please i beg you am just asking for just once; but if i don't pass thank you for taking your time on reading it; plus English is my second language and i dont understand it that much, and i can't read it that well either.    ",2.0,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,0

I disagree my first reason is,is you can try to do different things and help your future. My second reason is, don't be shy to do all things different. Last reason, don't be your self all the time because you never going to to know the world the you live and you never going to know your self if you never do different things.

You can try to do different things and help your future; For example if you want to do something in you life you need to start thinking about something, because in my family my sister past for the same thing the she was wasting time, but one day my mom took to her about her future if she don't start to thinking, and today she is a doctor because she stop doing the same things the she already have done.

Don't be shy to do all things different; For example my dad is was scare to do his company because he things all the work is going to be so different, and I told him if you never going to try different things we never going to grow in the future. and now we the company and the work in good, and help him a lot because hi try hard to do it.

Don't be your self all the time because you never going to know the world the you live and you never going to know your self if you never do different things; For example my mom she always said be your self all the time but one day I told her mom that is not great because if you be your self all the time you not going to rich want you want in life because your self like to do the staff the are simple are self don't like work hart to rich are gold in life.

This are are the words that British Minister Winston Churchill once said, and I am totally agree with him, to failure without loss of enthusiasm will creeate a person with experience and knowledge.

Once

I fail one time people think that I am a losser, but I see it in different way because I learned what

I did wrong in the first place, and I can fix the problem to make it perfect the second time. Moreover, every single mistake that I make give the opportunity to be success in life, so

I will never give up for any reason.

This remind a few years ago when I was in nine grade when my class took a test and I could not do it, so my teacher involve him self to make it try again as mush as I want it, so I decided to try the second time and still fail, for the first time in my life

I was going to give up, until my mom told me if you never fail and keep trying you are different than others. Hardly, but I decided to try again and this time the third time I new every single question and at the end I was the kid with the best score in class. if you ever thought about giving up with your first mistake you're wrong or because you fail one time you will never be successful, keep trying until you overcome every silgle obstacle.

Many people that are simbly of knowledge and success now were failure once. The important role that failure play in persouit of success. Failure show what kind of people I am and from where I coming, what makes me special and different from others.

On the other hand, people might say once you fail you will keep failing for the rest of your life or that I will never be successful person, but all what people say

I can use it to improve my self.

To resume, what the Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said "" success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.""? Its absultely true, if one day you want tio be succesful person you have to learn that there will be mistakes and fails no once,twices or maybe more times, but do not lossing enthusiasm will keep you in right way.

I'm agree with Emerson's statement what I already know that's a adventage for us . because it is easy doing something what we have already know ,but if we never try it , and we never know if we can do it, I need improve my self and switch my position that's a new goal . so many people they do not bealive them self , well we born poor people , so nothing is imposible ,trying what we want to do in the life . with the time we can get , and reach what we always dreaming.

You will never grow up , if you doing the same things in the life there is I lot opportunity in the world choose a new goal you will see so many change on your way don't give up.

It's easy doing what I already know because we feel comfortable doing ,for example on my work , I'm working busboy helping the server we working team work ,and easy but the problem is want to be a server but they never let me to try it i want to grow up swith a position to earn more money.

Creater a new things , we have so many skill to grow up don't be afraid doing or tying new things we want to improve us self I don't like to stay the same place doing the same things I don't see any improve on my life your life can be change a week but you have to be a positive ,don't give up , try it, isn't nothing bad.",2.0,2.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.4,0
2439,B548BF7A2A8F,"Hello, my name is Generic_Name. I'm student in the Generic_School, and the reason for this letter is because I have give my opinion about what I thing about the British Prime Minister said about the success.

I agree with the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill for this reasons: Failure in want pursuit your success do you make wrestler in the life, failure in want pursuit your success this one can do you make better in the life, and failure in want pursuit your success do you make more strong in pursuit your success.

The first reason failure in want pursuit your success do you make wrestler in the life I thing that because every day fight for want pursuit you success but many times failure in things but continued fight every day. Also I thing that because if you effort every day you fight for pursuit your success and that do you make a wrestler in the life.

The second reason is failure in want pursuit your success this one can do you make better in the life, I thing that because when you commit one failure this teach you to don't make that failure again. Also I thing that because when you failure that help you to want overcome more every day and make better.

The third reason is failure in want pursuit your success do you make more strong in pursuit your success I thing that because the failure give you knowledge in the life and help to make the correct in the life. Also I thing that because when you failure that help you to overcome.

I agree with the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill for all the reasons that can help you to pursuit you success though failure many times but you can overcome all the failures if you don't loss the enthusiasm, all can be more easy when you have enthusiasm and when you want continued forward with you life and pursuit your goals.

3052,D9D8AB28BD26,"I disagree with Emerson, because if you try to do something different of what you are doing you will grow.

But if you cap doing that same thing you will never grow. For example in your life you do different thing to know more about that world , you esperiment diferent thing to know thing that other people don't know to becme strong person and I thing doing different thing you will grow. For example when you are became father & mon you change you experiment thing that you never imagiane how that work. Like some people they still acting like kids I thing is because they talk we person they are not they age, they talk to young men like there age is 17 & 19 this you men they still dont know how to act like men, when there age is 40,

thas how you will never grow. Because a men change to a men is when they are 25 this is that age that you are change thing , and thas way people get old and they still act like kids.

Other people grow fast because I thing that wey how that family teache , like in all family they are not same they grow in difernt tipe. like some family star teach to there kids thing that they dont be doing , try to teache the better thing. For example when they are having diner all together in a restaurante some perent talk to there kids before they go in. they are having the food they need to be put off they table & phone ,to not talk when they have food in there mause at that time you star grow. in the fulture you be different that other people. like whent you goint to othere hause you will be better person for example your friend they you hey what are goint to do after school you like to have diner whit my family you know more beter thas how your perent teach when you are kids. Because when you are youn men and you still know how that work you will cap doing that wey how you learn Like other family they dont that ,when they are eat they use table &phone that wey you will never grow,you get to old person and you will cap doing that same thing that you be doing when you where a kids and i thing you main dont grow.",2.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.4,0
1969,950729DE3582,"Duke Ellington was a jazz legend of his time. One quote he said,"" A problem is a chance for you to do your best."" I will explain the meaning behind this. And if i agree with this or disagree. Let's begin on the meaning first.

The meaning that he is saying is that form your problem you can make it better for your self. To see your problem you can teach your self to do better. That not to give up on your problem. That something bad can turn good. This quote is trying to modevant you.

I agree with this statement. Something bad will in fact turn something good. Not all bad thing will turn bad

As long as you can make them turn out good. You just have to see a chance to do so. Duke Ellington also may of had the same problem.

Duke Ellington was a great jazz ,but was also so a great person. That something bad that can turn to something that is good is very modevation. I agree with this very much. This is what it means and my opinion on the statement.                                    ",2.5,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.3,0
2306,ABF21C9A2160,"Are we the future.? Ralph Waldo Enderson said."" To be yourself in a world that is costantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishement."" I agree with the statement of Enderson. May be some people will disagree with me. So I think is hard to be yourself in a world that is constantly changing because technology and social norms.

First the new inventes and advances in technology has brote new changes to our lives. We live in a world that is sorrounded by new advances in technogy. This has become essential and indispensable to preform our daily activities. For example the internet has become very important tool and so essential that we can't stay with out internet for even a day. We costantly surfing the social media. even if we love and hate social media we are always conected. We want to know what others think about us. With out knowing we fall in a new world call internet and we make chages just to be acepted, love even hate by othes.

Second we are part of a big sociaty. We born, grow up and died in a sociaty that has norms that we fallow. This norms sometime are written norms that are laws and if we brake this laws the sociaty can punish and we face consequences. Some norms are just unwriten norms that we fallow in our daily life. This norms can restrict our selve expretion and can stop us for doing what we want. So to fit and be aceted we fallow the social norms. For example if we go to school we must fallow thier rules to be able to get in school. We can't just walk in with a sexy litle dress and havy make up. The norms of the school are make for your to fallow the dress code. Even if you feel like the dress code restrict your personality and selve expretion. this norms are make for everyboby to mantain a the order and balance.

In conclution I must said that I agree with Enderson's quote "" to be yourself in a world that is costantly trying to make your something else is the greatest accomplishement."" therefore we emgrace new technology and follow social norms to keep the balance and maintain the order. We are part of a change together we can achieve new ideas and build a better sociaty.

So we can leave a better future for our childrens.              ",2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.5,0

No, i don't represent the character traits ,i would like the British naturalist and politician to choose the character traits ,i also know that we must allow the British naturalist ,and politician to choose the character of the government to help raise the to help the US institutions and American individual who pass through the management that also cannot gain experience.

Therefore,American government should help the people to give or allow bass positions and cannot gain experience, i also give the opportunity by those who are one and highly options to develop the habits of passing out freedom for all African

Americans,and American .that will help avoid racism to people in America and also the make the politician allow Americans to vote""i can do to achieve it ""and i will also brainstorm my idea to help me do the right thing to do to help the British and they a saying that""I CAN DO ALL THINGS THROUGH CHRIST WHO STRENGHTEN ME""this proverbs drawn me to help my fellow ones and also to achieve the little things thats letting me become a great person in the future some people achieve the smaller things that help them succeed

Another significant attitude is that these These Americans, is counted to give the logical manners of American that have the right to have the need to whatever pleads them ,like food,clothing,and all other resources i would love to help the government provide, but in all honesty, i also think we can manage stuff beyond our control by letting the president know what the government stuff in American will need to in other to help the homeless shelter and also providing whatever they request for like money,food and other kind in other to help them shine and happy .and helps me gets close to my family closely by going home to do my assignment ,eat .but when i also get home, i rest and do my laundry i try keeping my clothes clean everyday .

finally,my conclusion of other feelings and emotions is also what make me a great,if not the best candidate for the position which i was providing since i was younger ,i have always been an active and responsible person ,who can help others and i also know its vital in others workplace in my power to work on anything i could be responsible for in other to help the state department help to provides all the goods that needed for all Americans and also do what its allowed to do by paying out your tax to help builds school,help people when they in need and also help the government pay off stuff to support.

my mom always puts me to clean the house but every time i went to do the cleaning, she used to say ""you din't clean here or ""you are missing a part of the floor that still is dirty"" so i just say to my self next time i'm gonna clean better in this part of the room and i keep smiling not given up.

To learn how to clean the house in a perfect way i decided to clean the house every Saturday so i can practice more , it passed two month and then i went to clean again and i mop the floor , clean the windows , clean all the tables,so i finished and my mom says great job you now know how to clean in a perfect way!!.

However from what think if you are alone out of no where and you don't have any exprerience is much better because you get to have your experiences and no one bothers yours plans. You make your own decitions and follow your own rules. On the other hand if you have some one on your back that do have more experiences them you they will be correcting you and bodering bothering you. Some people think that is better to follow some one decitions, but others think that is better to be alone because you must create your own decitions and follow yours rules is like you have a family no one is going to correct what are going to do with your family you don't follow others people they may be incorrect and you are correct and is better to be alone becuse you make your onw family whit your decitions and your rules.

To begin alone is better because you make your experiences from the mistakes.

you make your own decitions, but went you make a decition that coust you a mistake you get to have more experiences from the mistake that you did and went you have experiences from the mistake you learnd from the mistake that you need to be more responsible went you have a mistake you get to have a big experiences and that make you more strong and what you do and that makes you feel good and you become more responsible from the things that you do form the experiences that you have some people see that and they will have a hope on you and that you are going to be some one in the future and they will know you better because you are alone and not with some one that has more experiences you will raise you and your decitions.

Another think is that you must follow your own rules that you make. When you make your own rules no one is going to say some think to you they will follow your rules if they want to be with you however if you are with some one that has more experiences you must follow their rules and you dont want that to happent went you make your own rules and follow your rules you will know what is goint to happen but if you follow some one else rules you must be awear because you dont know what is going to happen, so is better to make your decitions your rules because you know that is good from what are you going to do so make your own rules and follow your own rules dont follow some one else rules you become more strong and more smart person.

Fanally the last reason why you should be aonle is that no one is going to bother you you will make every thing in your hands and no some one else hand they will not be on your back bothering you you will make every thing posible on your hand and if you are alone you will become and expert on the jod,company,schools the things that you do you will be the head on your decitions and you are no going to use some one else head and if you use their head they will correct you in what you do and if you do is like from what they thing is better ithey will be bodering you and that is not to good because it will be bad why it will be bad? Because they will make where do you walk in a way that you must don't want to walk they will make every thing possible to walk in their way and you want to walk in your way thier will make every thing possible they will bother you and no yuo must follow your way and your road to make every thing possible to have your own experiences and your own rules.

Practicing is important because. One example is when I learn how to play soccer. The person that teach me was my cousin Im still bad but Im learning. Another Example would be when

I learn how to bould on fornite. I learn how to bould and sauces by my cousin. Lastly when I learn how to aim on fornite. I learn because of my cousin and he teach me how. Learning a skill Is better then not to.

I was waiting then got in the park and it was fun. In some cases Is better to be pation then not to.

Loaning a tik tok daced for me Is a skill. For example one dace would when I made my own dance. It was easy and I lorn. Another example would be a hard danced. I tried to duet but it was to hard so I quit. Lastly would be A danced that was hard but

I did step by step and I enjoyed. Loaning can sometimes be fun.

Practecsin is the way to success. An example would be a hard assignment that I did and it was hard. Second would be pattion when I need to.

Especially if they are important persons like friends,family,or girlfriend in those cases People get afraid to loose them or make them unhappy.

""JOHN LUBBOCK"" once wrote a amazing quote that speaks the true. ""your character will be what you yourself choose to make of it. that quote along changed my mindset, many people would disagree with John and his way of thinking but i personal agree with what he wrote,theres a lot of true behind his words, People shouldn't focus about others opinions or let bad experiences or events shape its character. I personal believe characters arent beyond our control after all we are the ones that control our way of thinking and reacting to them. My self has seen my tree closes friends Generic_Name,Generic_Name and Generic_Name ended up really bad after they decide to let bad events,experiences, and opinions shape the way of their characters.

Generic_Name one of my closest friend decided to let one big events shape his character and at the end everything went wrong for my dear friend. When he was a little kid he contently got hit by his parents in he grew up mad and he started using violence at school he would get in trouble all the time and his parents would get super mad and would use violence against him too they say it was to ""teach him a lesson"" everything went like that for him until many years passed and he got married and he contently used violence every time she did something wrong, he was mad about what its parents did to him so he would always hit his wife until one day he end up killing her and himself.

Generic_Name my other close friend let experiences shape his character in a bad way.

when he was a young man falling a love with pretty girls many of those girls just wanted to play with his feelings. Those girls never took him seriously until one day he got tired of the way girls would treat him and he loose feeling and he become just like those girls he didn't like at first. My friend Generic_Name started playing with girls feeling and he end up by him self and never finding true love, one he got true love but bad experiences make him loose feelings for all females and he played the one true love he had.

Generic_Name friend of mine let opinions got the best of him, he was contently trying to be someone he wasn't just so people he love would love him back but at the end he was just hurting him self because he wasn't happy like that he was just lying to himself and acting for other people.

people dont let bad experiences events or opinion to shape the character you yourself control or every one would end up like my friends that decided to let others control what they would have to.

2203,A46DA0EA4F5D,"Four-day School

Debate between benefits and disadvanges. Resume any doing school activities on regular five school day and change that for only four day.

To have a four-day school week, is an option that has to be adopted not only for some of the businesses workers and also by each high school and higher education school after see this reasons.

That is consisting of lose ten hour per week. but those missing hour can be recoup it by extending the school day two hour and increase the time for each class per day, that is an option to increase the atention and time on each class and complete any proyect or assigment toll by your teacher, and if we get the extra two hours, we can get more time with friends and teacher for suport between us on any class someone is failing.

Also, we can adopted an option for the fourth day on the extra two hours, used for time on the library, that can be amazing for the sturent who love reading, or students who love extra time on the sports, or any activity after school.

The fifth day of the week can be used for doctor appoinments or any health situations, you know the great excuse for missing classes on regular school time is because the parents write a note explaining we will be absent of some periods of classes. Doing any that situation on not regular time of school will deacrese the sturent missing on any period of class.

Without forget the teacher's situations who are the parents at the same time and need one extra day for family time and doing regular acctivities with their sons if that they have.

Don't forget the situations on seniors who are the most difficult situations on their life, decide for future, and they need time for keeping all option from universities and college for do the next step, higher education nad considered also job for weekends, also about freshman, who are the chlidren from middle school, they are the situation on needing understanding from extra activities on high school changed from their last rutine.

Another opctions for Friday or Monday free day can be used for community service, with permition of parent and some supervision of some adults, any students who wants participate on this can go and help on cleaning up street and river or any help on relation with community service, also the schools can create any program that consist on get many big companies who wants help students find a job on this new free day and may be part-time on weekend.

Considering:

Only four-day school, forget about the fifth day on school (No coming a little time for five days use the full time on four days)

three free days per week (use this extra time on family or friends meeting, any thing you and your parents want)

No wake up on Friday mornings or may be Monday mornings (dependes on the detition of the school about which day is going to be the third free day, use time for rest and complete responsabilities)

This idea can be not convenient for students with part-time job, because by following this model by extending the school day two hour will decrease the student's time sheet, even though if every one on this situation can use the fifth school day that will be free for a full-time job and get three full-time job.

Always remain. BE ON TWO DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES PER DAY CAN BE HARD AND EXHAUSTING, going school than going to work is exhausting because you don't have time for rest. But, if you get only four school days even though the school increase two hours you will have time after school for rest and doing any proyect or homework and use the other three days for any job you think is convenient.

Knowing disadvantages also remain the solutions and benefits for each disagreement on this proyect, because there are ore of the benefits than disadvantages for more 90 percent of the students.

After mention all points on considering benefits and disadvantages and solutions on that. To a four-day school week. Willingly I conclude with ""Everyone need a three day free from school and just four days on school"". Even though if any student's situation is diferent for using this free day, stay in home, family rutines, helping on home rutines, working or studing.

First, they can get distracted, In my position

I Can get distracted went I am at home doing homework i want to wache TV even some time I do not finish my homework because i get a lot distracted. I want to play whit my brothers go out side play soccer and i say just for a little I am to playing with then but a get distracted and i for got the i have to do homework or study for a test. Some time I get distracted by seeing my brother playing video even went they is a lot of noise i get distracted because i want to what is happening or what is going on. I remember one day the I have to finish a test review at home because I do not have time to do it at school I do not finish because I get distracted by brothers. They were making a lot of noise and i could no concentrate because of then. My brothers are the same way as me they can get distracted fully easy and not pay attention on what they doing maybe they star by doing they homework but they do no finish because they get distracted by the TV or the video game.

Second, they can use the telephone some time I get a lot distracted whit my telephone because I away want to be in the telephone. Went i home I just want to be in my telephone and i do not do my homework. I get fully distracted because I want to text whit my friends or playing video games in my telephone and not Du what i suppose to to do. Went I am at home I have all I want my bed my telephone the TV the I forgot the I have to how or study for a quiz or test. Only because I at home and I have all i need some time i do not want to do anything

I get distracted fully easy and more if I have my telephone in front of me because i want to leasing to music or video chat my friend and talk and pay attention on what I suppose to due. Some time my mom tell that I have to stuff in the house so I have to do it even if I am doing homework or studying I have to what she say and then a can kip doing what i was doing. If I have my telephone whit me the only thing i what to do is be in the telephone because it is a easy way to get distracted and not due what you suppose to due.

Some people my say that if students have home school it will be good because some students can get bully at school and they do not want to go back. The is say for then because some the students do not ride the bus the parent have to take then to school and the take a lot of time some time because they have to wait. Even they are going late for work and they do not have tame to take then to school. They may say the if they have school at home they do not have to do all the work by taking then to school. some time a lot of kids get bully at school and it more easy for then do do it by home because they do not have to deal with at school they do to have to be worry what would happen to then the net they or what does people are going to do whit then, But I chose to not have school at because some people can get distracted I not saying the all people have the problem I am just saying the i have the problem they my not have. But I do not like have home school because i want to see my friend graduate whit then have fun some time go to party and now more people have more experience.

have good relationship with your friends and make someone trust in you to tell their secret to you. Well that is what i think about Seeking multiple opinion.

Seeking multiple opinion can make someone trust in you. When someone trust in you, he or she can tell you their secret about everything they have in secret. If someone trust in you he or she will know that you are a good friend. For example,

if you do something wrong to your friend who trust in you, She or her is going to forgive you when you say sorry because, he or she trust in you. Being nice and respectful for example, not saying bad word to someone to be depressed, saying please when you are asking someone for something can also make someone trust in you.

Seeking multiple opinion can make you have good relationship with someone.

Having a good relationship with someone is a good thing to do in life.

Having a good relationship with someone can make him or her get close to you . Helping your friend for example, helping him or her with his homework or something he or she needs help with , advising him or her to do the right if he or her did something wrong, being nice and respectful to everyone can also make someone have a good relationship with you.

Seeking multiple opinion allow you to make new friends. Sometime when you are making new friends you dont just have to make friends, you have to think about it .

Make a friend who respect everyone, correct you when you do something wrong and someone who is there for you because, when something happen to and you have a bad friend, he or she will not help you but, If you have a good friend, he or she will help you when you are in a bad situation. Good friends are all way there for you when you have a problem with something or someone.

Well that is what I think about seeking multiple opinion. I hope you know some benefit of seeking multiple opinion . Whould you like to seek multiple opinion from different people ? I also hope you learn smoething from what I think about seeking multiple opinion.

People who stop and fail they don't learn from there mistake. The ones who fail and self believe they learn form past mistakes and try again. By practicing over time the person can understand the subject or the materials they'er trying to learn thats how some people can be successful. People who don't practice the won't get any where in life or get to there goals where they need it to be.

Winston Churchill say ""susses is consists of going to failure with out loss of enthusiasm"" yes i do agree with his saying. The reason being if you fail for an example on a math test you got an 53 but now this time on the retake you want to get a 80 now that's a goal you want to achieve. By practicing over time people can learn there mistakes from there past experiences and see how the develop over time. People who become famous, millionaires, and company owners they had good and bad ideas but they still became rich or powerful people by learning their mistakes. Winston Churchill is tilling us that by failure and believing in our self we can successful.

There are many ways to be successful to get where the person wants be to. The first step is were and how to start company or store. Second step is how to get the money, recourse, and a company to. Will the two steps are that easy,step number 1 always start off small use a room or make a stand out of wood if that doesn't come up with other ways. The second step buy the material off the item the cost mummers are buying if that a back fires you can always use you own money to buy the rests like company poster. Thats how some people can have bad or good ideas.

In conclusion people can be successful or not by learning the mistakes they make in the past. Finding a way of how people can practice there mistakes an be more productive in the future. Sitting a goals and having more of what you expected to have for example have a higher score on a math test. Having ideas and recourse to start small business.

3152,DE3867FD43DE,"well hello today I will discust the diferent between working wit a group or working alone first let me ask you a question how hyou like to? with a group or alone? well i chose working with a group lets see why...

working in group and working alone have advantages and disavantages for each one,I like wirking as a group because your team can help you with some ideas and ways to do your work and at the same time have fun while your are doing the work. disavantages in a group there will be always a person that want to be just playing around and don't like to do any type of work just have fun. nut if we being on the side of be working alone thant advantage will be that you will have more oportunity of do your work the way you want to and no be worry about other people opinion. you will finish your work faster and the way you want the wor kto be done,but some disvantages you will no have fun because you have no one to be with and it will be difficult to have a lot of ideas. i think working with a group is more beneficial because if you think there will be more people at the ppresentation helping you and you will feel more secure with your work.

working with a group can help you to increase your skill level of talking and self confidence and being social(meet new friends) , working alone can sometimes can get borring and you dont finish the work because you don't have someone to share the ideas with,

workingt alone can cause you a damage on yuor personalty and your aparetion people will think i he don't like workign with aother person around that he should work by it self andf then there will be a lot of caos that person fall in depresion because no one acept him and it was because you make them to be like that or feel that way.

while you are working with a group you learn skilll like having respect for others and diferentsd way of doing things and work as a team,or even for example you love play sport well you can not do it by your self because there will be team, and how you will work as a team with out learning how to work as a group, you need to learn how to work as a team if you want to be succesful in the comunity, in your future working with a group with the perople you trust you learn that friendship is alway good for you have thar confident that people you like being with help you to increase on your life that is a feel that no one can easy aford it.

went oyu are working with a group friendship will always be there why because is the keey of being succesful on your life. in your future, and your career, in your job.

for example;

lets said that you was driving on the higway driving normal but you forgot to past by the gas station you are in the middle of the street you don't have gas well if you don't like to work with a group then you will push your car and problably you will end up getting a desease or crashing another car.

while if you learn how to work as a group then you can have four people helping you push your car others stop the traffic and some calling the police to help you with that issue.

now you see why it is importan to learn and work as a group, even though with that you already meet new people and have new friend,what I try to said is that working with a group help you a lot in harders things that you need help with.

working alone is depent of what kind of personality you have and if you love working with out people than is fine but there will alway a time that you have to work as a team or group becasue there are things that someone by them self can not accomplish.

when you work as a group you gain respect and great friend ship because if you help with everything then everyone will love working with you and you now will feel that you are important and useful, something that working alone it will be dificult to make.

well i hope you like my explanation i did my best and i feel that we should be more socialize with other nad let then join us for our better future so they can have friends and they never feel like their are alone, lets make everyone happy and having a good time helping other and always respectful.",2.0,2.0,2.5,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.3,0

My grandma, always said that being in a group gives you more things to talk about. The benefits of working a group is more beneficial because,more ideas, partisan,and some one you can talk to.

Many calm that working alone will not share your ideas with other clearly, it better working in a group have fun and to talk to others.

To begin the benefits of working in a group is more beneficial because having more ideas. For example my sister, Generic_Name she loves sharing her ideas. Each ideas they share with they classmates. They can have have a example on what there writing about and have an idea on what there talking about. For example my Mom,is A fourth grad teacher she loves seeing others sharing it means a lot to her. She partners up the kids and so she, can see on thing the can come up with. However,having more ideas well help us share ans being thoughtfully to other in life.

In addishly,the benefits of working with group is more benefice because, to pertipat in a class room. For example when i first stared middle school i didnt want ti partisan with no on. Because, i wanted to work bye my self. Later that week i made a Friend and, she intrdust me to the other class mats, we all disided to be together for this school project. Example my little brother Generic_Name ,he was shy to talk to others in the class room. I as an oldest sister, to if him they no need to be shy just talk to others and pertipat in class and get to know every one. that next day my brother was happy to with others. However,partisan is a good way to show others an example and make new friends

Finely the benefits of working in a group is more beneficial because, having some one to talk to for example my friend Generic_Name, didnt have have nothing tot talk to for example my friend Generic_Name,didnt have nothing to think of .I was helping her on some thing we can together thinks of. I as a friend was there to listened to was she had to say. Example my other friend she wasnt at school because,her Grandpa, pasted away she misted on what we were working on. So i want to show her on the thinks she missed out. It helped her a lot.

2913,D242BBCBEAFB,"Some student can take classes at home because they could find a subject of course that like. Learning websites can help them get better at what they do. It could benefit because they it would seem easier to go on different classes or to take a video to study a subject. For example, taking classes online would give you a head start. Many other schools have students at home take taking these course and have them apply for it. It is like a benefit for them to take some opportunity to get taught about something they have learn or to have a different way of learning it.

I will think they would able to do this if they are interested. For example, Home-schooling could that much money. There could be some reasons for them.

1. They want to try out some different learning strategies.

2. They can apply online.

3. They can try taking some subjects that they like.

3417,EAB299C6ECED,"First Impressions are almost impossible to change this is true but they can also slightly change a little bit over time. I personally agree that is almost impossible to change an impression about someone so lets say that I agree and disagree because the statement is right but not everyone is the same, your thoughts and the way you think are different from everyone else, so the way you feel about a person could change over time. The first impression of a person about you could change over time just like your first impression about someone you've never met before could change as time passes and yall get know each other and hang out, go out to eat just like in a relationship, when the girl meets the guy and he looks so handsome, respectful, polite, nice, generous, very responsible from her point of view, when his at school, work, even when his home or even to the point of calling him sexy even if he is the skinniest guy ever you would tell him ""Wow baby, you're so sexy"", even if his not you would say it because you wouldn't want him to feel bad or anything to ruin that bond but when you guys start talking even more, start to hangout more often that bond will start to grow stronger in confidence and trust so when that time hits, It gives us a whole 360 degree spin now you start to be more open with your partner and you actually start saying the real things, Im not saying you have to lie but people in specific try to cover their lies with other lies and some times it dont even work or it don't add up at all but what Im saying is that when that right time actually hits you start being more open and you're not afraid and for the same the reason, you guys develop your ways up and work it out to the point of building a really strong trust, that confidence in you guy's eyes, that key to your heart and let everything be free.

It will take a while for you to see the prove but probably not to long but the results will come at one point and don't doubt it. however, with your first impressions you will represent yourself to the people or the way you act or the way you act in the beginning it will make them know if your child dish, immature, or the opposite.

If you put that respect and honesty in the beginning people will treat you with respect but if you like to mess with people yell at them without respect don't expect something else because it will come back to you and there's this verse in the Bible that I like that says "" what you plant, thats what will grow"" I don't think i wordily got it right how i said so what its meaning is if you're a lair don't be mad or don't ask God why is he doing this to you because that's what you planted in the beginning. When you meet a person what are the first impressions you get of that person on how they look, act and talk. When I first came in Generic_Name class and actually met her, my first impression was she's very nice, knows how to properly talk to students and as time pass I got my points proved right.

I agree with this statement, because the time passes in your life is going with it, the more you do the more you get and that is what people don't get, if you want to make accomplishments in your life you have to worked out man, For example Lebron James how do you think he went where he is now, Making steps in his life, goals, family help, you have all of it it is right there you just have to get it.

""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else""... honestly I will not take it like is changing you, because you are the one changing your life, yes you will be seeing stuffs you will make some errors but that is how you are going to reach what you want in life. you are going easy you will get it easy and you will get it shipper too, if you work hard at the first time, at the end it will come easy and you will be thanks full.

A great accomplishment?, That can be anything, every one is a world, what I mean by that is that every mind have the power to do what it have to be done, either a teacher, family, friends, they are just telling you where is the door, your friends are not going to opened for you, not your parents or teachers, you are the one who will opened if you want to do it and get out, and get that goal or accomplishment that you have to complete.

I can be a example for this, I used to hate school a lot, i went tot his time that i didn't wanna even go there, but there was this English 10 teacher that just speaking with me one day just one day, yes I was having F at that moment, after all that thinking a lot about what she said I passed her class at the end with a B, not knowing that I was going to be able to do it, but I did it just doing what i have to do, like I said people can just tell you where is the door you have to go get it.

389,1D8BDC81DE2C,"What does it mean to partnerships with a companies? I think it a good ideas for Many students who look for opportunities before they go to collega. Student will get to explore certain work area and what type of work they want to do. If student want to work at a company they can visit the company and see what kind of work they do. If school partnership with companies it will help many students to choose what type of work interest them. I think they should select me because I like to be around people, I want to know what type of jobs I want to do, and I want to have a experiment about jobs.

There are so many people who don't like to be around, but I really like to be around people. I think when I am around people It give you a postive feeling. Anywhere you work or go and your around people It alway give you postive feeling. If you work in a company there will be people that you have to work with even if you like them or don't. One time at my school we were in a group project and I didn't know the people who were in the group and I didn't know what to say. Then I started talking to them and now we are friends. Whenever I am around people even If I don't know them and when I start talking to them I feel like I know them for long time.

So many student alreadys know what they want to do in future, but I don't know yet what should I do. I always ask myself that what I am good at. I never figure it out what is something I am good at. I think not someone can get the jobs they want ,but If they select me to It will give me the opportunities to find out what types of work I am interesting in. It will really help me If I know what work I want to do. There are many people who are not happy with their jobs, but they still have to do it for their family. I think people should choose what jobs they want to do.

If I want to work at a company and I don't know anything about the company how can I work there. I think before you work you should have a experiment so you know what is the jobs about. I wanted to work at a resturants, but I didn't know what kind of work will they have so I ask my friend who have work there. If you don't have experiment you can research about it. There are work where you don't have to have experiment, but in some jobs they want you to have a experiment. I always wanted to be a nurse so I always wanted to learn about nursing. If I get select I would have a opportunities to explore about nurse and I will get to have a experiment.

However you should not select me, but you should because I like to be around people, I want to know what type of jobs I want to do, and I want to have a experiment about jobs. I like to be around people because I think it give a postive feeling.

2246,A828480AA508,"Successes comes in so many diffrent whays,but the real questchon is how can having a good attitude lead you to being more successesful in life. I think that starts with your attitude ,attitude plays a big part in your life, for example if your about to take a really big test in math class and you tell yourself befor the teast that your going to fail and your just having a negtive attitude about it, your more likely to fail ,but if you walk into math class with a good attitude and your cofdent in yourself and your just going to give it your beast I thinkyour more likely to pass the teast.

When you think of successes you think of famos people you might think of a person on tv or someone that hass lots of money. If you think about it the people you wach on tv or any of the people you think are successesful hade to have strugled in life to get to the place they are now. What ever the strugle was they hade to get back up and push themself. There are successesful people every where fot example it could be your mom, or your dad, brother, sister any one you know. Successes doesnt have to be a big thing it could be you doing something like running a mile or being the first person in your familly to go to college or just geting all As in school Whatever it is having a good attitude in life can really change your life.

I try to be as successesful as I can if thats in school I try my beast,Whatever it is I know I cant acomlish anything without a good attitude. For example in the fuetre I want to be a fashon disinor, but that whount hapen for years but thers things I can do to push myself to the thing I want to do. Things I can do now to get to my futer ,I can start with a postive attitude There are hatters every where that try to bring you down you just have to learn how to ignore them and learn how to creat a path for yourself.",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.0,2.5,0

Thired state park:

in the state park it's more qiuter than national park, less people comnceting and give each other ideas to do a project envolving any subject.

Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it.'Do we choose our own character traits ,or is our character formed by influences beyond our control.

Although some people think that character is formed for other persons that are around them and that their character is always going to be formed for people around them but character is formed by the way of your own emotions that shows how you feel how you are, other people says that if they don't be like other people want to they be they feel out of the group in that moment some people starts to hate their self, but what other people do is they ignore what people says about them as they don't hear anything and never give up.

Other people think that if they don't change their character they are going to success in their life and that they are obligate to change for they future and when they change they start to feel bad because they change something better than what they get and when other people ask them for what they change they says that for be an adult they have to be like one but what is a adult is a is a person that looks death and is always mad with other people or they say that the character is formed from the moment they born and that hey can not do anything about it .

In my conclusion, We choose our own character and it's doesn't have nothing with others person ,we choose how we wanna be and how we feel better with our self...

These days happen and it's sometimes gonna be annoying and one thing can not ruin your day. Their could be a day that you get a good grade on your test and you feel happy for yourself, but then you still have a bad grade. People always have some smile in there face and the other people think that their having a good day which they are, but in the inside you don't know what happen.

There are some people that make other people days. Some people have feelings for other people and they get sad when they have a good day, but then they have a test to do which they don't wannna do. Their are even dogs that make people days, but they still think about the difficult time that they had today. People forget what their doing but then remebers what happen. Difficult time happens and you can't help It only If have a good attitude.

Their are sometimes that people have a great day but at the end something bad happens and there were your day is bad. Sometimes people don't like difficult time like stressing out, had a fight, got caught doing bad things, but they still smile becasue there trying to forget about that and think about something better.

I am tired to use all this drogas, i want to be something else in my life. Since this moment he chenged his life. Now he wanna be a doctor for to help people to become a some else in their life. I am agree with Emerson's statement about individuality because i can demostrate that they said is wrong, to show them what is defference between to make and to talk, and to be concetrate. Those thing i can show the people that i can doing with myself and that make me a greatest accomplishment.

I feel to be myself, it is not depend what people said about me. If i want to change or to be something else in a world, i have to do what my mind say to me, for example if i wanna be a teacher. And they tell me to be a teacher is not important because their payment is trash, they just can earn $1000 each months. But if i like to be teacher do not matter what i earn. They will trying to make me confuse. Maybe they already tried it, but they could not do it , that is why they believe that i could not do it either but not all time is the same, the world change every day so i need to try to show them that what they said it, it was wrong. So it is important do not pay attention people who try to make me confuse.

Also there are two defference between to make and to talk because i can believe in myself but if i just talk and to say i will do this, i will do that and i will not doing nothing. That way i can help the world even i lie myself. But if i did not said none and to show people that i change my life with my attitude. they will come at me and ask me what happend with me? because i am changing. I will tell them that i want to be something else in a world. That will be my greatest accomplishment.

Even if i believe in myself i need to be concentrate because i am human and i am not perfect, i can fail with my decision if i am not concetrate. Because bad people will like to see me on ground they will tell something fun that i missing. For example to study, many people do not like to study because they say that school is boring so that i am doing they believe that is boring. They will try to convence me doing wrong things so i have to demostrate them that i wanna be something else in a world not just have fun.

In conclusion, work individuality is not easy i have

To showto the people that sometime we do not need help from somebody else. Just believe in myself, do not heard what they said about me, to show them what is the defference between to make then to talk and all time to be concentration in what i am doing.

Being enspired by someone to do that instrumet or what ever you want to do you need somone to motivate you for example, their was this one time where my brother motivated me to play the chello and I did and it felt good,because I practiced everydaycand I loved doing it. Thats why practicing is important.

Having fun while playing in band or orchestra your able to travel to diffrent states to learn how difrrent groups play,

learn diffrent songs, and learn the sites of that certain city. Thats why I joined orchestra when I was about 9-10years old I learned about 20 new songs that 1 school year and I loved doing it. It was fun to watch, and hear them while playig it was probably the best year i had in 3rd grade.

The people in your group are like your family you guys are going to travel together and perform together. And even making freinds to the new kids who join later in the year so dont worry about being left out while traveling to that certain state your always going have someone to talk to be around.

1157,5985EA6F171A,"I think is a good idea that the students start thinking about what they want to study in the college, what they want to be in the life, and they start preparing for the future in the high school. It is a good idea because they can start working when they are really young, It is a good idea too because they can make money when they are young, It is a good idea because they can buy they own things with their own money, like a house, a car, or whatever they want, and they can get graduate really young and that is the way to prepare you for something.

For example you can stop living with your family you can be indepent, nobody can tell you anything you can rent your own room just for you and you can have your own space, another example is that you are young maybe you make a wrong decision in the career that you choose but the good option is that you are young you already did the high school maybe you already work so you have money you can start another career more important something that these time you already liked because you are more older you know more about what you really want. Also in the work that you have you can study a little bit more and you can scale to another position too much better when you are young you're body don't feel so tired when you work because you have more energy, but when you are more older your body start feel tired, you start loose energy the sickness come your body hurt you have to go more to the doctor, so when you are young you can work more for you retirement.

In conclusion is a good idea that the students start commit a career at a young age because that are going to help them to be someone in the life, also that are gonna help them to be an important person. But the more important is that you are going to work in what do you love to do. The benefit of start preparing for a career since the high school is that you are going to be a young with a lot experience, also that help to the young students stop thinking on bad things, like cigar, tobacco, alcohol etc. Also help them keep their mind busy and to be in high school and not in the streets with bad friends that help them to keep a educational way. And is something that they are going to use in the life and is something that is good, what we need now is a societies based on education because that is a good thing because the education come with a lot of opportunities and with that opportunities the students can lear a lot, the learning is the best thing on the world.",2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,0

Students who commit to a career at a young age always doing better things in them life, and when students get a old age he or her always know what they have to do because they trust their work when they was young.

Ex: Generic_Name said, when she was a young, she was trust her things and it was always teaching her many thing and shows her what to do and how to be, and many people was care about her, they was not doing them things without her, when they want to do their things, they was waiting her because she was help them and teaching their, and she get an achievement in her life, and reach her goal.

2267,A9A6B5A288DC,"Should some people believe in praising a student's work to build self-esteem, even if the work is not the student's best effort. They believe that students must be self-confident in order to learn. I agree with students must be self confident because its better to grow in life then stay in the same place over and over again. If a student does not believe in what he or she can do then that student will not be able to compete things in that student's life time. Also a builds a great mindset for the student to keep moving forward. Students should have self-esteem for a successful life.

If a student doesn't believe in what he or she can do then that student will not be able to compete things in that student's life time. Student that doesn't think that their capable of doing more that student will stay the same and would not be able to grow, also that student self-esteem will lower down. Another thing a student should getting moving up and high than he or she can do is there are no limits in what that person can do if the student knows that they would be able to do what they can do they can easily grow by practicing more and believing they can do it. So by not believing in what he or she can do that will affect what will happen later in life, never stop believing in what he or she can do as a student.

Building a great mindset for the student to keep moving forward. To have a good self-esteem the student will have to set up goals to show to their self that that student can do more. Another thing after writing down their goals is which one will they do first or which one is do he or she want to compete first. With all the choices to choose like for example: goals, friends or family that support, or how will is the student want to succeed, because even if they don't try as hard as they know how to it could happen to anyone in life that shouldn't make a student to stop trying it should make them feel like okay it wasn't my best my first time he or she can get the second time because a student should always chase what they are willing to have. Building a great mindset for the student to keep moving forward is good for a student to have a great self-esteem. The reason students should be praising for their self-esteem is, because no students should say no to even if it's not their best work the first time everyone should have a chance to have a great self-esteem and to keep growing in life.",2.5,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.5,2.4,0

If the curfew adopt the teenagers, the situation will change to the better. the council said the teenagers don't have to be in the street after 10 p. m. in the weekdays because they want the teenagers out of troubles. and they found teenagers in the street after 10 P.M. that's mean is breaking the law. that warning for the people because sometimes the bad people walk around have a knife or have a gun these people can kill someone kidnapping anyone. Or someone make a bomb and try to put it in street. and also is danger because maybe someone drank a lot and he drove the car maybe can hit anybody by the car that's why the police check the city a lot of time to make sure no bad things will happen and also the police check the city because if someone have something wrong they will help them. if the teenagers don't break the law this will help the police to try make the city safe the safety in city is so important. Like example that happen with me when I was 15 years old I was walking in the street at 11 p. m. and I was going to my home I see one man behind me but I thought is regular man but he was have a knife and he said to me give anything you have I was have my wallet had on it my ID and not too much money and I don't have anyone in the street to help me and he took my phone and he told me leave and don't look behind you I ran away because he was almost gonna kill me. be in your home early to be safe. The police doesn't want to control on you but he want to be safely. because the world is not safe now the world have a lot of bad people. And also I was have my friend was in street at 1 a. m. and someone was drank and hit my friend by the car. And my friend is dead all of these to show you how the world is not safe. the police have a lot of situations with the bad people. and if you look at the countries is not safe the reason is because every day around the country you will find everyday someone killed. That's tells you how the world is not safe. a lot of people dead because of the people is drank or the someone have a gun or knife. if you search in internet about the people is succeed in their life the internet will show you these people focused in their future when they finish their work the going to their home to take a rest. try to make your schedule early like in the mid day in the morning to go to your home early.

Wilnston churchill, he say that success in life or anyother things, theres a failure and don't lose enthusiasm because of that litlle things or because you fail one time in your try.

I agree with the minister churchill say because succsee it's a way to improve your skills or be betther in what you did and you try to not haves more make mistakes annymore, success can have failure but also you can lern for them, and learn how to rersolve your pronlemsand see how far you can go by trying, how you can have more expiriense by traying and traying again and again, no making mistakes annymore so the next time you don't have the same mistakes or pronblems because you larn about it.

I think with success you can learn a lot of experiance in your life, because with your failure you learn about it, because if you leave it like that you not trying and you are not exploing your self, so if you exploit your self you can see how far you can go to resolve the problems or the mistake you have.

So if you explod your self trying more and more you can maybe resolve the problem or see how far you can go to find a solution, the thing is if you keep trying your best in somthing you don't know exacly what it is or how to resolve it in many times you can find a solution and fix it.

failure is not you are not going to resolve it because if you are doing your best but you keep failure is becuase you need to find the problem you are not seeing, to resolve it failuture is not because is not working success is because you didn't find the solution at your problem.

For my conclusion for success you have to pass for a lot of problems and mistakes so you can find a solution for it, in your life if you don't explow your self you won't know what was the problem to that but if you explow your self you can find the solution and also learn from that, trying hard and hard moust of the times you can find a solution for evryting and that is how you also you can help others with they problems like when they say two heads is better then one.",2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.2,0
2253,A8D0ADC676C0,"Everyone would eventually ask an advice if they need help on a particular subject or ask for an opinion if they ever get confuse. Advises or opinions would solve one's problem. For example, to prevent making poor choices or decisions, to determine which advice is accurate, and to allow someone to feel secure with choices. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.

First, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice by preventing making poor choices or decisions. For instant, if someone attempts to steal. If there's something you want but it's expensive. Also, if someone gets in a fight. If there's someone you don't like or disagree with. Lastly, if someone lies. When someone did something wrong and lied about it. Seeking multiple opinions can help some make a better choice.

Furthermore, seeking multiple opinions can help people make a better choice by determining which advice is accurate. For example, to be sure that it's reliable. If many said the same thing while others said a different thing. Also,if someone wasn't sure about the advice. Ask people for more advice if the advice is inaccurate. Lastly, if the advice is inaccurate. If someone said one thing while others said the other thing. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.

Finally, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice by allowing someone to feel secure with choices. For instant, if someone gets confuse. If you're lost on one subject. Also, if someone gets lonely. if someone doesn't have a baseball team. Lastly, if someone gets worried or afraid. If someone you know is absent or gone. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.

In summary, viewing many opinions can benefit people to make a better choice by preventing making poor choices or decisions, determining which advice is accurate, and by allowing someone to feel secure with choices. I believe that asking yourself for advice is also necessary. but, viewing many opinions from people is probably more necessary than viewing your own advice.",2.0,2.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.3,0

When you constantly trying to make you something you learn something that you don't know; something that surprise you because you never think that you can do, and you say I can do that thing and I want to experiment more things spontaneous because is better when that things have spontaneous because left better and so cool and impressive to you. Experiment more things new help you to be better every moment, to that these for you can helped an others persons when they need our help, when meet with one situation where somebody need help motivate that he or she can do it nothing is impossible, because a lot of peoples in the world don't believe in their self because all that time suffrage bullying they thing that they don't serve for nothing they believe in that bad words, is for these reasons that one situation appear in front of our eyes helped, spoke with love,respect,be courteous because when you spoke with one persons that have these problems where suffrage bullying, bad words that others peoples say they feel miserable have hatred,resentment and all of times they don't want to talk, you need or our need to going to these peoples and spoke with love, love is one of the most good gun that we have is the most important in that around world.

The first reason is the older students give a advise to the younger students, the older student are helping with the younger students because when the older student are giving advise to the younger student make them intelligent for example when i was in elementary school in fifth grade my principle asked my teacher to give information or to give idea to the third grader on their project and my teacher sand us to the third grade classroom and my classmate was helping with the third graders.

The second reason is to help them make more understandable on their subject, the older students are trying to make the younger students more knowledgeable in their subject. for example when i was in sixth grade the my best friend was in seventh grade when i needed help with my homework or with same other classes homework and she was always helped me with my homework, testes, and quizzes and i was getting more understandable in my every subjects and she teached me how to solved problems.

My Teacher Wanted me to Share a Lesson With Elementary Students

.

Next, I told The Students, What I was going to present to Them. it's very Important to Speak With The Students About Something interested That They Would Love, to hear About. I told The Students What They Want to be when they grow up, They said I

Want to be a Police Officer one Day. The other one said He Wanted to be a fighter fighter. And I told Them to Become a police officer or a Fighter Fighter They need to graduate high School And Get a Degree For College And Take Those Classes, to have a Good Job for The Rest of Their life's. Finally When My Presentation Was Almost over Suddenly' The Students Ask me Those That I'm going to Take Do I have to Past Those Certain Classes to Get my Degree, Also I Said it's Not That Easy to Have Your Dream Job That You Want. You Have to Work For it And Earn it And Try Everything You Could We're You Want to Be. Motivate Your Self, Push Your Self If You want Your Career that you want Then, Always Believe in Your Self When You Have a Dream Career Don't Give up on it. When You Give up on Something You're Not Going To succeed in Life. I'll Tell My Self To Get Back Up On Your Feet And Chase Your Dream. But in Life there's No Second Chance. Last, When You Finally Acheive Your Dream Job You Can Thank Your Self for Believing in Your Self and Working, Hard every day. because After All The Struggle, You Been Putting Your Self to Succeed And That's Why you Are We're at And Always Chase Your Goals to Succeed.",3.0,2.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.5,0

First i want to be something in the the future i will choose my won character, second i will choose my won character to be socialize with people and third i might chose my won character to take care of my health.

First i want to be something in the the future i will chose my won character. For example; my parents wants me to follow what they wants to make my character but i'm not agree with their decision, they wants me to be a doctor in the future but, i want to be a pilot in the future, so i will decide my won character to be a doctor or a pilot and i would choose what is best for me.

Second i will choose my won character to be socialize with people. For instant; I love people! spending time with people around me helping me to learn how to build my won character better, being socialize with people mean you have more friends and spending time with them can help me to learn new things from them and experience them might help my won character.

Third i might choose my won character to take care of my health. whoever health is more important to me, health is depend on my won character ,for example; if i eat healthy food it's can help my mind to think about my won character, if my health is not good i won't be able to follow my won character so, we should focus more about our health,so we can be able to choose our won character in conclusion, it is true that your character will be what you yourself choose to make it. i want to be a pilot in the the future i will chose my won character,spending time with people around me helping me to learn how to build my won character better and if my health is not good i won't be able to follow my won character.

94,06FA8EF28227,"Many people in the history of the world were important because they become who they want to be, and now society try to persuade people from who they are and change to what they want, to be your self in a world that is constantly traying to make you something else is the gratest accomplishment, also you decide who you want to be

I agree with this because some times parents try to change their children, also school making decision for their students, religion first point parents trying to change their children, in some cases parents try to persuade their children from what they want to do or from what they want to be on the future, if some one of their children want to play soccer and if their parents do not know everything about soccer they search anything they just say no and they make their children to try something different or if the child do not want to go the place that they are going most of the parents do not listen what their sons want or like and also sometimes parents make their children to be what they do not what to be in some cases parents tell they children that they need to play an instrument liket the guitar but maybe that child wants to play the drums. some famous people are unhappy because their parents make them to become famous but maybe that child do not want to do that.

second point some times school makes decision for students too some times students do not want to take some classes and school choose for them, in some parts students do not like to wear uniforms and they make them to wear it, in case that you came from other country and you do not speak the same language you need to be able to learn because if you did not do it you are not able to be in the school and if you do not understand what are they talking about is hard but you need to be like them because you do not have people who speak the same language as you do, so you have to be part of something even if you do not like it third point religion is there to try to change your mind they are many religions in the world but all depends if you want to choose one of those religions but some times people try to make you part of that religion and some times you change completly of who you was if that work for you is perfect but if not you are going to be completly different person, you need to dress different at you usual do, and also they tell you what is wrong and what is not wrong even if you did not do anything wrong they think that and they always want you to belieb things that maybe are not true but why we need to follow that and why we need to beliebe that, so if you want to do something do that thing because you want it not because someone tells you.

In my opinion I agree with what Albert Emerson wrote because to be our self in this world that is constantly traying to make us something else is the greatest accomplishment, is hard to be our selfs because people are always traying to tell us about what we are going to do because for the society what they do is good but maybe you have a different idea but most of the time you need to do what they tell you to do the best accomplishment is being ypour self and being what you want to be and if you want to do something just do it and do not listen about what other people say or what they think because people are never happy with the things that you do.

161,0C30A2A5D998,"It success consists of going from failure? I think that there are people that are successful and have gone through failure because without experiences people will not know that is out there. I believe that in live there is gong to be up and down and this teach us who to be an successful person.

First,to have a successful live we need the experience to be success not matter who many obstacle we have. When I was eleven I star making cookies at first I was bad, and when I fail the first try, but I keep going to make cookies not matter how bad I was. Then as I keep failing, and one day I was able to be successful. People have to know that we are not perfect and in some point of live we have to be unsuccessful to became what we one to be some day, Also it very important that people have the capability to say that they have make mistake.

Second,people have up and downs. As an example J.K Rowling she wrote the Harry Potter sires,and she want it to published,but she was not successful,and then by the time her sires was one of the most famous book. I believe that any one can be an successful person,but they have to know that not every thing is going to be a success at the first try.

Other believe that success is not consisted in failure because they think that people can be successful with out making any mistake. Thinking that every thing is easy as an litter kids puzzle.

In conclusion failure is one step of been success because every person can process the piece that their missing to be successful. As people have been going in up and down,and had experiences who thing are going.",3.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.5,2.5,0

So you don't think that to be mistaken is wrong, but if you make a mistake, try to don't do it again. I give you a example: If you are on a game (football,soccer,basquetball,etc), so if you are on any game and your time is lose, but you know the wron in the other team, so you know that you can attack on this wron and you can won the game, or if you lose that game but you got the revenge, well now you know where is the wrong and maybe your team won the game.

here are reason why they should be achievement .

achievement for student more hard working than praising student . for example let say you are try to work very hard if the teacher praised to student the student going to give up the work or get so upset . student needs achievement to more work done.

praising is not a bad thing. so this is why people should pick an achievement .

let say you wanna make students to do some project for about how to draw an art . if one of them succeed on their project and other one praising him it will not make sense for them . but if you active them that will be their for history of their school years.

and lastly achieving the student makes them more happier than praising the student . because may the get high points or good grade (A or B) or better than praising the student .i should say self-esteem comes from achievement .

Also students help their parents taking care of their sibling after school, some times also students help their parents at home as clean the floor, wash dishes, make dinner and time for their hobbies, made the life of the students more easy at schools and at home.

students that like to do sports after school as soccer, fotbool, basquelbal, or tennis, some just wants to have a little time of peace by themselves as reading or walking alone those little thing is what a student can miss but if teachers decide to extended the schools to hours late, students also are going to work the same amount of time the only different is that they have to work to hour more each day to complete the forty hours work for week, and those two hours would private students to do what they like to do and make the life more happy.

The other companies can check the books and the games in the large screen because they builded the large screen with their technology and they can speaking with other person and it's important to help to the person with their comunication because we need to learning about to the new tehnology that they builded and the employee need to brings good ideas for the boss for to do the games more better with the new technology.

with the other technology new they can show the books in the other companies and they need to do activite with the other employee then the need to have good life and they need to do vacation for relax for that have good ideas the employee to have access for get more better the games because they want to build good games for the persons the employee need get something that can they to do idea they can work with the other person that they can to do good work.",2.0,2.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,3.0,2.4,0

I disagree imagination is more important that knowledge.

I disagree because, I think knowledge it's more important because, you have to knowledge after you imagine because, I think knowledge it'a more important because you have to knowledge. The situation to think really good if you dont due you can not think what it's gonna happen.

because if you only imagine you don't gonna knowledge good because, if you only imajinate and say the words after you knowledge the words you what to says. and if you knowledge first after think you can be able to due son tings.

If you gonna to due a story if you only imagine you can not be able to due because you have to Knowles the situation first after you think because son times you can get good imagination and you have to knowledge.

like for example if don't knowledge you don't gonna now were put tings to knowledge the situation were you gonna put things and the ca n be better.

I don't no what scientists Albert Einstein think and i gonna now what he thinks because, people have different opinion like how it's more better to they can use, and because persons have different ideas,like me i think then knowledge it's more important, then imagination but others people they can think it'snot because for people to see things it's different, because if the person am gonna write the story am gonna use the knowledge to knowledge, the situation better and make good story.

The knowledge it's like then a group because you have to search or knowledge to now what you gonna due because, if you only have in a imagination to what you gonna due that can work, like when you go to your job and you have to knowledge,what you gonna due for the day.

when you go to school and you go to science if you have to examine the a plant you have to knowledge the plant to now were you can star to examine the plant.

when you due sometimes you have to knowledge the situation,like for example,when a person quilled to another person, the police they have to knowledge,the scene and who was the criminal and knowledge the situation how died and who was .

some people think the imagination it's was first and it's more important would, I think the people see for different forms to due would a think some people it's right because, I see for different forms like when you imajinate it's like when you imajinate the things would you can have a picture in your minds like you can see pictures like were you what to put things.

but you can have im imajine in your mied but you have to knowledge first because i think if you knowleged because i feel more necesary to knowleged beause when you knowledged you can feel it's more easy or if you look like the pictures way it's more easy, because you see the things more specific en your miend.

it's alot ways to you can see things because for people some people looks diferets to others you can see more better in you way if you don't get.

First, the students has more distraction in home; with vedeo play, and othe oction, more students work a time with taking a class, more with have a classes in distance, the schools need a tanking a other options. With lern in school the students are more specific learn, with a have a teacher opposite the student to learnig more specific, when she tanking the classes to has a more effective for a students.

Second, I hink this option for learning offer the class in distance wich a attend classes from home; not is a good option for example: in my house a have three brothers, and one sister, I think is distraction wich learning in home.

In finally; with reason with not is good idea the learning a distance the school, I think is more elementary, basic to taking the video conferencing online, because; learning more in the watch the vedeo conference, with online; is more effective memorize with the morning in not in evening, the students have forceful in the morning, but no think this is a good option for a students, not have a good benefit from being able to attend classes from home.

If your school extend school day for two hours there are some thing you can't do. You can't play after school games. You can't do your homework. You have less time to work. You going home late. You can't fresh your mind.

Reason one, students who work after school they have moer time on work. For example, if your working time is four o'clock to ten o'clock. If you work regular time you going to make more money. Students need to work becaus they needs to pay the cell phome bills or on gasolin.

Reason two, students who want to play after school game they can play the game. If they don't have time to play after school game they can't fresh there mind. For example, students who live one or two hours away for school they have time to play after school game.

Reason three, students can fresh there mind. Students can't fresh there mind because they are studying more then they need. For example, some time students can't remember what they learn in class, but can do other thinks. Some time student haveing so much fun in the class. Because there mind is so much fresh.

some reasons why they should know more aobut a career at younger age are:

They will be ready after they graduate and know'ing what are they gonna do.

It will be more easy after you graduate you don't have to worry about what career are you gonna study,

and it ognna make you more responsible.

Some students don't like this idea to be guide at a younger age they don't want to worry that much,

some student just want to finish high school firts and they have 4 years to decide what are they gonnna do after high school and what career are they gonna pick.

3674,F65622698950,"Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing""?

I believe, when most of the people don't understand how relevant is to do something instead of being inactivity that also serve purpose because like everybody else it is normal to always do or make good things for someone, and it could be family or close friends for example.

My reason is if we try to done good stuff for people, and not receiving anything back for example: If I give people chance to not try anything, then how are we gonna communicate? how are we going to accomplish our goal when you don't deserve it? so my point and my reason is the we need to do something about not being inactivity with people are around you. I understand that not everyone are gonna have the same thoughts as me or with other person. However we need to be on the side to the change for good.

I grew up knowing when people put a lot of their afford to you, it means a lot because you'll never know when people will trust you and believe in you again it's a huge difference between those, and we people show us or make us see how important is when almost everything is easy when we ask for it example: Trying to hard to show how many things you have done for that person without asking, but it means a lot to you because you give a lot to that person and you hope that person can give you the same thing you've done for her or him.

Sometimes some people misunderstood about always doing something for her or him like you don't have to do it for them, but believe you'll feel great if someone do something for you isn't a bad thing then you will be fine and grateful knowing that theres good people around you, and ready for help you. You ain't alone anymore believe theres people for you and try to not think too much about it.

My conclusion is about to always do something for people because there is people who will need you, and being around, and everything you want to do for them it will make it better like. Thomas Jefferson wanted to do good stuff as a president caring about his people, and making him one of the best presidents, so it is wonderful to done much for them than yourself.

Having a specific career while being young student would make the student more responsible and creative of what he is going to do for his life with full of confidence, because in growing up more hard decisions the student will have so he has to choose the right decision, being creative at his career will let the student get a big succeed, and being already chosen a career is enough by itself to stay away of the people who failed in their life because they dont have a goal or career they can get.

2286,AAE16C990870,"To begin with, I am going to be listing my reasons on why i agree to the statement that the former British prime minister winston churchill said. In each paragraph I will be supporting my reasons.

To start off with, My first reason on why i agree with the statement Is because their Is always a saying that says keep trying don't give up. When i read this statement I see that saying because you can't give up you got to keep trying to get what you want.

Second, With the statement saying ""success consitts of going from failture to failture' I agree with just for the smiple fact that In life you will go through some rough times and you may not always succeed In what you are trying to do or accomplish, because someone will always fail at something they are trying to accomplish but will keep trying because at some point they will complete what they had tried to accomplish the whole time.

Last, Someone can't lose hope of trying to complete something because they will complete it. They have to stay motivated to keep on going and keep on going to complete it. Everyone will be successful but If someone just gives up and doesn't keep trying then they won't get what they wanted to accomplish. Some people don't know that enable to succeed they will fail at it plenty of times but they would have to keep trying to succeed at it and can't lose hope.",2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,0

In my opinion I think it would be great for the health of the school and student to have a healthy food during school hours, one main reason is bacause it keep our body,healthy strong in which we can reflex our education, It will benefit all the students mainly the ones that are in PE class,eating healthy can improves more day of life and better human body, eathing halthy can prevent you from disease and probably some virus.

by eathing healthy you will not only will be able to be on a good fit you can also feel good and with feeling good about your self means more thant anything in this world, my opinion about this i agree with this change and i would like to see more plans for the upcoming futre years.

every plas have good and bad opinions many student at school have said and have their own opinion, Many of them dont like to eat halthy they just wnat to eat and enjoy their life at the fullest, which is reasenable and i undestand they point, we all know that the food that make our body get fat and get worse is the bad type food but we all love that kind of food, is delicius and it taste great for example pizza, hamburgers and all those kidn of food.

To keep a balance and for the students to be better and feel better about them self i think it will be the best to have a schedule of food for example :monday healthy food, Tuesday bad food...

In my opinon i thik it will be the best for our students and for everyone in the school to have a healthy food schedule that way we can be happy and satisfy with our body. I agree with the plan of replacing the school food for a healthy kind of food. thanks for all your pation and i hope you like my opinions and you could consider this on your future plans.",2.0,2.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,3.0,2.4,0
2730,C8EBB096262B,"To Begin with, many student have many excuses to not attend school. Of curse, that we can change this to not be happen anymore. Student may not complete the school if they lose the year.

What would happen if student get affected for all student that not attend school? For example, like I seen in me that I have a lot of appointment that is affecting me and my grade. We can not let this happen we need to do many thing in order to not let our child lose. In addition,

principal should offer distance learning for student that the way could not affect them because student might have a natural disaster in their neighborhood, student might be sick in such manner that could not attend school, that might affect their grade and they might repeat the year.

First reason, student might be absent for a reason like to be sick in such manner that could not attend school. All included student that is special that they go for a week or more in the hospital. Moreover, student sometime the doctor let a lot of appointment for them to check up or appointment with the dentist. Also, student who have allergies when the weather change they got affect in that they may not come to school. In high school, student sometime they get pregnant and the doctor let them many appointment including when they delivery they lose many school days and that affect many student lose the year or they may get affect their grade. Because we don't know in the future what will happen to some of our student that many of them don't find any solution of their problem. In fact, we don't know what it will happen if we don't give an opportunity to our students. We must pay attention to them if they lose many days of school sometime they are afraid to talk about their problem.

Second reason, student in their neighborhood might have a natural disaster also might need the distance learning in order to not lose school days. Sometime the weather get so angry that may bring accident or can bring tree crashing in our hose or may get rain and rain that could bring floating that may cause a lot of problem to some our students. In addition, the school bus may not get as in order to come to school. If it a student that walk that student could not get to school and the County could not cancel the school or even in there's no light and that may tell an announcement that student could not get informed about the school information weather. Because, if student get that problem the principal could not believe and it can not give an chance to those student to take the test or the exam that they had in class. After all, in the school no one care about you even if you have a teacher that it is so inpatient.

To end with, the school should offer the distance learning to some of our students. Student may got sick for a little reason and if they had natural disaster, we should care about it. If we find a student that always is absent we should ask them what is the matter or what is the problem with them? While some may argue that if we offer the distance learning student may not lose school days and even they could not lose their grade student could have benefit from this way student could not lose, however some may argue that if we gave the distance learning to student student could not enjoy this learning they just will playing even if we give the distance learning in computer they just see it they they will start playing video game or they just will watch a video.

i think some of student want to go help the community and some of them didn't want to help the community but i think that student should perform community service because we not let down the student who wants to go and help the community because if u say the student will not perform community some of student will think that this is unfair and they will not agree with this decision. all i have to say is that student should perform community. have a great decision and also thank you.",2.5,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.5,2.4,0
3103,DBDE16551908,"I think the best way is to work as a group. You might ask why. is the best way students get to learn, For example; I'm the type of student that like to hear about peoples opinion. By listining to other people opinin give the other student a idea on how the project or the assigment should be done. When student get the chance to express they idea they feel confident no fear to express themselve.

Many students like to work bby themselve, therefore no other student interrupt the by asking to many question. Most of them already have a topic to talk about they already have a plan. For Example student that work alone they mostly working at their own pace, working alone give then the chance of finishing on time.

Working as a group give the student the chance of dividing the work in different sections, For example; this student would do this part, the pther student would design the project, the other student would do the research. Dividing the project in different part let the student look or choose the part the thing is easy to do ot they know how to do it already.

Student get to meet new people, by doing a project like a group student somtime don't get to choose who they work with, The profesor might give the students a group of people they never meet before. working as a group with new people let you find a new ways to work or write. For example you meet this new student who make a T chart and write the good about this topic and the negative side about the topic next to it. After looking at it he decide what side he should talk about.

You get things done a lot faster by doing in groups as I said before working with a group let the work get done a lot faster, it's give the people the chance of focusing and the part they have to get done. If you finish your part of the project or assigment, you can volunteer to help other team mate. For example someone that works by themselve might need more time, because she's working by her self and you get the chance to volunteer to help her out on something, she might found difficult to do.

In my conclusion, working like a group it teach the students to listen to other peoples thoughts and, it's the best way students work as one. But other peolpe would say that working alone is the best choice, because it teach the student how to make decision on their own and how they should write their own paper with anybody helping them out.

2367,AFC600D922F6,"I agree because being yourself is very hard sometimes and feel a lonely. Today is in the world nobody like to be all by themselves but some people like to be themselves. If you being yourself you can able to do more work because nothing else to do and feel like board so let study something, work hard. How about your fun time go out with someone, you can't be work hard all the time because that is not a good experience. So I do sometime fun myself and be yourself It's doesn't means you can do any a good stuff. You can do something what is make you feel a happy all your life. don't feel strange yourself and being strong.

First, I like be myself sometime because that make me bring my own idea and also help me figure our myself. What is a good thing or what is a bad thing for me. That make me strong because I using my own bring and think twice myself before I do something. My first year was be American be myself without Family, I feel very sad, and I sad to myself I never want to be myself my life again. I want to go back where are I am came From, I don't want to be in American anymore because know language very important for me that time. I don't understand any English that time and I don't have any Friends. I still remember how hard the was being yourself and I never knew be yourself Will be that hard, Now I know.

Second, after couple years I make my own choose I wan to be myself but no more sadness. So what I did was no looked what other people do and people I ignore with Friends they're all together or family because that make me sad. I could't told you how bad that feel was for me and I relax everything will be fine, I take deep bread. Now I don't worry about be myself anymore because now I know that wasn't that bad after you use to and also, infect that make me a little bit more independent.

Third, Now I responsibility everything myself and be myself that make me diff rant. My last year was raft because my faster Family said to me you have to learn do stuff by yourself. I am so norvise because I can't do anything whiteout them so I have to learn be myself before turn eighteen.

3427,EB1500B8EA75,"Some students who live far away from their schools; they prefer to attend classes from their home instead of going to a school, attending classes from their home can affect some students education and affect their live in a future beacuse not all of the students who are taking online classes are going to complete their work .In my opinion I think is a bad idea to attend classes from your home because students can get distracted for anything, not complete their work and get bad grades.

If we have online class it can be hard to these people who got distracted for anything .Once I had a friend her name was Generic_Name, and she had a online math class that she needed to be able to graduated. One day I went to her home like at 6:00 pm after shool and she was working in her online class, but honestly Generic_Name was not really woking in what she suppose to be working on, yes she had her cumputer on and her online class open , but she was getting distracted by the her tv show just because she like the beaty and the best she stop doing her work. My friend Generic_Name she suppose to do her work but she always got distarcted by her tv show, if she had deside to turned off her tv she didn't got distarcted by anything and she could be success in her online class.

Students who attend classes from their home as there is anyone who is reminding them to completen the work some of them forgot to get it done and they had an incomplete work. This year I am taking an online class and sometimes I forget that I have to be doing all my requested assingments, and by the end of last week I got a bad score because i didn't complete my Vocabulary assingment. If I had put a alarm every day to remind me that i have tostudy and complete my asssiments i could get a better score.

Some others will say that attending classes from home can be a good idea because they can work on in any time,however,others may say that is a bad idea beacuse they can get bad grades. Some classmate that are taking online classes they aren't reading all the directions that the class is giving ;they are just doing the work without reading and that can affect their grades. Having bad grades can made you to not pass your school year, but if we efort we can be great.

For some students is consider to take online classes, but in some point can affect them in their education. There are many students who have online classes and they are falling because they dont have enough help, and some of they because they are not doing it .If schools provide after schools help for online classes will be helpful for all student who needed to be more success, and feel more confortable while they are doing their work and also teachers to be cheking if students are able to pass.

For example right now am doing a sol if i aim to high in order to pass and reach 12th grade and to get my diploma my aim can a low and i can still have a achieve my mark .

Everday you do more you learn more, you acomplish more as long as you believe, and have the heart for it .I don't like braging about my self but I am allways doing something. Right now i am 18 and belive it or not i own two busniss. I make good money but it everday is a struggle to keep the busniss runnig good and going to school but i never once thought about stoping here i wana do more i wana be sombody .

Frist, reason why i agree with Thomas jefferson is becuase if your idle you will never make it out i promise here is a example Donald Trump he is one of the richest people in America and he has his own air plane decraded with 24k gold so you know he has accomplished a lot of things he can be retired living in a island right now but right now instead he is the president of united states you know why becuase he is not a idle person he wants to do more like what Ragin(rip to thats mans) said ""dont ask what your country could do for you ask what you can do for your country"" and that is what Donald is doing right now he is doing more and acomplishing more .

also, its okay to be idle some times we humans everydody needs a little break just as long as you believe. And make goals for your self you will be alright.

1496,736E8C8444E6,"Had the technology a negative or positive effects on people's lives? People are having a negative effects with the technology, I think people can't control it. At this time everybody are forgeting how beutiful is lives with out technology. We can do alot of things with out it. For example: Play outside with friends, go to libraries, and stay outside with natural. Some people say the kids have to have limitation of what they doing on they computer or cells phones. On the other side people say that is good for teenager having not limitation because they can learn more. I think teenager need a limitation of what they doing in the phones. Furthermore parents should cheking what they doing in the internet.

However, some people think is good for teenager not having a limitation because they learn more for their future. On the other hand some people say that that tenenager can't complete a taskd with out having contact with other person. I thinbk having a conversition with other is good because you get to know that person and also get stronger the relationship. When you meet a strager in the internet is dangeous, not everyone is a good person. Some parents think that the kids are just playing in the internets but they do not. I think having a conversiation to you or playing games without speaking I think that have a limitation until you know well that person.

In addition, sometimes people used to buy alot of things from the internet without knowing that person, that is dangerous. People that are seeling on wedsides that always offer what the really have or maybe they just want the money. If you going to buy anything for the internet just make sure the wedside is safes. Buying staff for the internet is getting wrong because people do not want to go aout and spend time with family. Since wedsides liike Amazon, Ebay, and others came up people atart get all they need from wedside. Bad people are used this on favor to them, they are creating so many fake wedsides to racket people.

To continue with, I think a good way to get the kid out the technology is take them to have fun outside like hand out with friends, having friends in a computer like into a videogame or a social media is not healty for the kids. You have to get to know the person before play or talk to them. Sometimes people trick the kids ask them to do bad things.

That why technology shoul not be allow for kid at all or if parents decide to give a cells phone or a computer always have to be a limitation.

Technology does not aloww people to complete task with out haave a contact with others. I think this is having a negative effects on people lives, people are getting racket because they used to maney wedsides. Wedsides are not save you have to have a limitation and also take care of the like. Kid are also getting into the technology they are losing their childhooh.

867,42587039161D,"Do you think technology is helpful ? I think Technology allows people to do many stuff and i think its postive because that way if you have to go buy grocery you can just go grocery shopping online something else why i think it is positve is because pepole can also work from home like lets say if you work in a offiice you can use your laptop so that is what i think about this. For example when my sister feels sick or does not have time to go grocery shopping she goes online and she gets her grocery deliverd in front of the house.

Another reason why i think it is postive because lets say if you dont drive and need a ride you can download the app uber and get yourself a ride to go where you would like to go. Another reason is if you need to clothes shopping there is no worries because you can aslo go online and see what you want to buy if you dont have time to go in the store to see what u need you can always go online. something else is you do not have to go to the book store because you can read online and even check out books. you can bisically do everthing online pay your payments so many stuff these are some reasons why i think tecnology has been positve in peoples lives. Also another good reason is my grandma lives in Generic_City and now we can also facetime her from a diffreant country thanks to technology. One reason why it could be negative because if pepole order stuff and dont go out to buy somehting in the store they are not getting enougeh extracise and they are just being really lazy. Another reason why it could be a negative is nowadays pepole dont even talk face to face all they do is either text call stuff like for example when i go over my grandmas house for any holidays my cousins they dont communicate all they do is sit there be on there phones these are some negative reasons.

So these are some reasons why i think technology is positive nowadays. Another good example is when i go to Generic_City or travaling anywhere what my older sister does is she checks us in so that way we dont have to wait in the big line at the airport and we already have our seats picked so that is also a good thing. like i said in the top paragraph in my postion technolgy has been really halpful for pepole. you can really do anything with your phone you can also pay with apple pay if you leave your wallet at home that is something you can do pay with apple pay.

Everyday, when we wake up we need to think about today what is plan we need to finished? do not lazy, many people need dream. One reason, If we attitude to think about what is plan need to finished ,we don't feel boring., we feel a lot power. For example: the students will know next class should be taking the test ,the students plan to study tonight ,they do study guide, more practie during the test they will get good great.

I think your students should have community service but i think its only fair to the people that do something bad to do community service, because for example some of the students at school litter and if they do and you catch them you should make them do community service for littering. not all students should do that only the kids that act up because if you put all the kids in that your gana be taking their time away and its gana be worst there gana get mad.

1759,856351253492,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" Will if you try will you be able to grow more? Does it matter what you eat? What can you do about you height? I disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson because i dont think that you can make yourself taller. He say if you try will it even work? I still think if you try it wont work because the height we have now is because our father in heaven made how we are now.

First, it doesn't matter if you try or not your height and how you look it comes from your parents genes, and it can also come from another family member. I don't think that you can do anything about your height because it depends on your family too. Even if you try you all you can do is to try to have a nice body, but about you height i don't think you could get taller then you already are. The only thing that can change is your body what i mean is if you chubby, over weight you can do excuse so you can have your body the you once wanted to have. If you really skinny you can eat a little bet more, but if you like how your are now you dont have to change anything. But like i always say ""Love yourself and how you look no matter what people say, the only one who could change you is yourself.""

Second, I don't think you can make yourself taller because there is no way that you can become taller then you already are , and don't you think that the really short people will be taller by now then shorter.

I think that they would not like to be short because in this world there is really mean people that will laugh about others, or how they look, and how short they are. So that is why I think that there is no way to make yourself taller.

Don't you think that short people will be short, and be laugh at no they would not like that son that is why i disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson.

In the other hand, it does matter to eat healthy so you can be in shape and you will be in this life longer. Normally you can do anything about your height because trust me if you could i've been taller by now. I don't like to be short because sometimes i get judged by my height, or how i look, and how chubby i am and i would like to have everything perfect like all those ladies and girls in the magazines or in the TV shows, and i would like to be 6 .3 ft tall then 5.3 ft. So yeah they is no way to change how you look , but by fixing yourself like: Appalachians, surge, and other things you understand what i mean right.

So that means that i still disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson because there is no way that people can make them self taller because even short people or person will be the size or shape they will like to be. This world is not that perfect because if it was everything or everyone will be how they world want to be in this world. So that is why i disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson as you can see i give reasons and examples.

This goes to the person that ready's my story please give me a changes to pass just one i have never pass an SOL before and i will be really happy if you could pass me just once in my life. On this one i have tried my really best so you could understand me what am talking about.

So please please please i beg you am just asking for just once; but if i don't pass thank you for taking your time on reading it; plus English is my second language and i dont understand it that much, and i can't read it that well either.    ",2.0,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,0

I disagree my first reason is,is you can try to do different things and help your future. My second reason is, don't be shy to do all things different. Last reason, don't be your self all the time because you never going to to know the world the you live and you never going to know your self if you never do different things.

You can try to do different things and help your future; For example if you want to do something in you life you need to start thinking about something, because in my family my sister past for the same thing the she was wasting time, but one day my mom took to her about her future if she don't start to thinking, and today she is a doctor because she stop doing the same things the she already have done.

Don't be shy to do all things different; For example my dad is was scare to do his company because he things all the work is going to be so different, and I told him if you never going to try different things we never going to grow in the future. and now we the company and the work in good, and help him a lot because hi try hard to do it.

Don't be your self all the time because you never going to know the world the you live and you never going to know your self if you never do different things; For example my mom she always said be your self all the time but one day I told her mom that is not great because if you be your self all the time you not going to rich want you want in life because your self like to do the staff the are simple are self don't like work hart to rich are gold in life.

This are are the words that British Minister Winston Churchill once said, and I am totally agree with him, to failure without loss of enthusiasm will creeate a person with experience and knowledge.

Once

I fail one time people think that I am a losser, but I see it in different way because I learned what

I did wrong in the first place, and I can fix the problem to make it perfect the second time. Moreover, every single mistake that I make give the opportunity to be success in life, so

I will never give up for any reason.

This remind a few years ago when I was in nine grade when my class took a test and I could not do it, so my teacher involve him self to make it try again as mush as I want it, so I decided to try the second time and still fail, for the first time in my life

I was going to give up, until my mom told me if you never fail and keep trying you are different than others. Hardly, but I decided to try again and this time the third time I new every single question and at the end I was the kid with the best score in class. if you ever thought about giving up with your first mistake you're wrong or because you fail one time you will never be successful, keep trying until you overcome every silgle obstacle.

Many people that are simbly of knowledge and success now were failure once. The important role that failure play in persouit of success. Failure show what kind of people I am and from where I coming, what makes me special and different from others.

On the other hand, people might say once you fail you will keep failing for the rest of your life or that I will never be successful person, but all what people say

I can use it to improve my self.

To resume, what the Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said "" success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.""? Its absultely true, if one day you want tio be succesful person you have to learn that there will be mistakes and fails no once,twices or maybe more times, but do not lossing enthusiasm will keep you in right way.

I'm agree with Emerson's statement what I already know that's a adventage for us . because it is easy doing something what we have already know ,but if we never try it , and we never know if we can do it, I need improve my self and switch my position that's a new goal . so many people they do not bealive them self , well we born poor people , so nothing is imposible ,trying what we want to do in the life . with the time we can get , and reach what we always dreaming.

You will never grow up , if you doing the same things in the life there is I lot opportunity in the world choose a new goal you will see so many change on your way don't give up.

It's easy doing what I already know because we feel comfortable doing ,for example on my work , I'm working busboy helping the server we working team work ,and easy but the problem is want to be a server but they never let me to try it i want to grow up swith a position to earn more money.

Creater a new things , we have so many skill to grow up don't be afraid doing or tying new things we want to improve us self I don't like to stay the same place doing the same things I don't see any improve on my life your life can be change a week but you have to be a positive ,don't give up , try it, isn't nothing bad.",2.0,2.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.4,0
2439,B548BF7A2A8F,"Hello, my name is Generic_Name. I'm student in the Generic_School, and the reason for this letter is because I have give my opinion about what I thing about the British Prime Minister said about the success.

I agree with the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill for this reasons: Failure in want pursuit your success do you make wrestler in the life, failure in want pursuit your success this one can do you make better in the life, and failure in want pursuit your success do you make more strong in pursuit your success.

The first reason failure in want pursuit your success do you make wrestler in the life I thing that because every day fight for want pursuit you success but many times failure in things but continued fight every day. Also I thing that because if you effort every day you fight for pursuit your success and that do you make a wrestler in the life.

The second reason is failure in want pursuit your success this one can do you make better in the life, I thing that because when you commit one failure this teach you to don't make that failure again. Also I thing that because when you failure that help you to want overcome more every day and make better.

The third reason is failure in want pursuit your success do you make more strong in pursuit your success I thing that because the failure give you knowledge in the life and help to make the correct in the life. Also I thing that because when you failure that help you to overcome.

I agree with the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill for all the reasons that can help you to pursuit you success though failure many times but you can overcome all the failures if you don't loss the enthusiasm, all can be more easy when you have enthusiasm and when you want continued forward with you life and pursuit your goals.

3052,D9D8AB28BD26,"I disagree with Emerson, because if you try to do something different of what you are doing you will grow.

But if you cap doing that same thing you will never grow. For example in your life you do different thing to know more about that world , you esperiment diferent thing to know thing that other people don't know to becme strong person and I thing doing different thing you will grow. For example when you are became father & mon you change you experiment thing that you never imagiane how that work. Like some people they still acting like kids I thing is because they talk we person they are not they age, they talk to young men like there age is 17 & 19 this you men they still dont know how to act like men, when there age is 40,

thas how you will never grow. Because a men change to a men is when they are 25 this is that age that you are change thing , and thas way people get old and they still act like kids.

Other people grow fast because I thing that wey how that family teache , like in all family they are not same they grow in difernt tipe. like some family star teach to there kids thing that they dont be doing , try to teache the better thing. For example when they are having diner all together in a restaurante some perent talk to there kids before they go in. they are having the food they need to be put off they table & phone ,to not talk when they have food in there mause at that time you star grow. in the fulture you be different that other people. like whent you goint to othere hause you will be better person for example your friend they you hey what are goint to do after school you like to have diner whit my family you know more beter thas how your perent teach when you are kids. Because when you are youn men and you still know how that work you will cap doing that wey how you learn Like other family they dont that ,when they are eat they use table &phone that wey you will never grow,you get to old person and you will cap doing that same thing that you be doing when you where a kids and i thing you main dont grow.",2.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.4,0
1969,950729DE3582,"Duke Ellington was a jazz legend of his time. One quote he said,"" A problem is a chance for you to do your best."" I will explain the meaning behind this. And if i agree with this or disagree. Let's begin on the meaning first.

The meaning that he is saying is that form your problem you can make it better for your self. To see your problem you can teach your self to do better. That not to give up on your problem. That something bad can turn good. This quote is trying to modevant you.

I agree with this statement. Something bad will in fact turn something good. Not all bad thing will turn bad

As long as you can make them turn out good. You just have to see a chance to do so. Duke Ellington also may of had the same problem.

Duke Ellington was a great jazz ,but was also so a great person. That something bad that can turn to something that is good is very modevation. I agree with this very much. This is what it means and my opinion on the statement.                                    ",2.5,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.3,0
2306,ABF21C9A2160,"Are we the future.? Ralph Waldo Enderson said."" To be yourself in a world that is costantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishement."" I agree with the statement of Enderson. May be some people will disagree with me. So I think is hard to be yourself in a world that is constantly changing because technology and social norms.

First the new inventes and advances in technology has brote new changes to our lives. We live in a world that is sorrounded by new advances in technogy. This has become essential and indispensable to preform our daily activities. For example the internet has become very important tool and so essential that we can't stay with out internet for even a day. We costantly surfing the social media. even if we love and hate social media we are always conected. We want to know what others think about us. With out knowing we fall in a new world call internet and we make chages just to be acepted, love even hate by othes.

Second we are part of a big sociaty. We born, grow up and died in a sociaty that has norms that we fallow. This norms sometime are written norms that are laws and if we brake this laws the sociaty can punish and we face consequences. Some norms are just unwriten norms that we fallow in our daily life. This norms can restrict our selve expretion and can stop us for doing what we want. So to fit and be aceted we fallow the social norms. For example if we go to school we must fallow thier rules to be able to get in school. We can't just walk in with a sexy litle dress and havy make up. The norms of the school are make for your to fallow the dress code. Even if you feel like the dress code restrict your personality and selve expretion. this norms are make for everyboby to mantain a the order and balance.

In conclution I must said that I agree with Enderson's quote "" to be yourself in a world that is costantly trying to make your something else is the greatest accomplishement."" therefore we emgrace new technology and follow social norms to keep the balance and maintain the order. We are part of a change together we can achieve new ideas and build a better sociaty.

So we can leave a better future for our childrens.              ",2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.5,0

No, i don't represent the character traits ,i would like the British naturalist and politician to choose the character traits ,i also know that we must allow the British naturalist ,and politician to choose the character of the government to help raise the to help the US institutions and American individual who pass through the management that also cannot gain experience.

Therefore,American government should help the people to give or allow bass positions and cannot gain experience, i also give the opportunity by those who are one and highly options to develop the habits of passing out freedom for all African

Americans,and American .that will help avoid racism to people in America and also the make the politician allow Americans to vote""i can do to achieve it ""and i will also brainstorm my idea to help me do the right thing to do to help the British and they a saying that""I CAN DO ALL THINGS THROUGH CHRIST WHO STRENGHTEN ME""this proverbs drawn me to help my fellow ones and also to achieve the little things thats letting me become a great person in the future some people achieve the smaller things that help them succeed

Another significant attitude is that these These Americans, is counted to give the logical manners of American that have the right to have the need to whatever pleads them ,like food,clothing,and all other resources i would love to help the government provide, but in all honesty, i also think we can manage stuff beyond our control by letting the president know what the government stuff in American will need to in other to help the homeless shelter and also providing whatever they request for like money,food and other kind in other to help them shine and happy .and helps me gets close to my family closely by going home to do my assignment ,eat .but when i also get home, i rest and do my laundry i try keeping my clothes clean everyday .

finally,my conclusion of other feelings and emotions is also what make me a great,if not the best candidate for the position which i was providing since i was younger ,i have always been an active and responsible person ,who can help others and i also know its vital in others workplace in my power to work on anything i could be responsible for in other to help the state department help to provides all the goods that needed for all Americans and also do what its allowed to do by paying out your tax to help builds school,help people when they in need and also help the government pay off stuff to support.

my mom always puts me to clean the house but every time i went to do the cleaning, she used to say ""you din't clean here or ""you are missing a part of the floor that still is dirty"" so i just say to my self next time i'm gonna clean better in this part of the room and i keep smiling not given up.

To learn how to clean the house in a perfect way i decided to clean the house every Saturday so i can practice more , it passed two month and then i went to clean again and i mop the floor , clean the windows , clean all the tables,so i finished and my mom says great job you now know how to clean in a perfect way!!.

However from what think if you are alone out of no where and you don't have any exprerience is much better because you get to have your experiences and no one bothers yours plans. You make your own decitions and follow your own rules. On the other hand if you have some one on your back that do have more experiences them you they will be correcting you and bodering bothering you. Some people think that is better to follow some one decitions, but others think that is better to be alone because you must create your own decitions and follow yours rules is like you have a family no one is going to correct what are going to do with your family you don't follow others people they may be incorrect and you are correct and is better to be alone becuse you make your onw family whit your decitions and your rules.

To begin alone is better because you make your experiences from the mistakes.

you make your own decitions, but went you make a decition that coust you a mistake you get to have more experiences from the mistake that you did and went you have experiences from the mistake you learnd from the mistake that you need to be more responsible went you have a mistake you get to have a big experiences and that make you more strong and what you do and that makes you feel good and you become more responsible from the things that you do form the experiences that you have some people see that and they will have a hope on you and that you are going to be some one in the future and they will know you better because you are alone and not with some one that has more experiences you will raise you and your decitions.

Another think is that you must follow your own rules that you make. When you make your own rules no one is going to say some think to you they will follow your rules if they want to be with you however if you are with some one that has more experiences you must follow their rules and you dont want that to happent went you make your own rules and follow your rules you will know what is goint to happen but if you follow some one else rules you must be awear because you dont know what is going to happen, so is better to make your decitions your rules because you know that is good from what are you going to do so make your own rules and follow your own rules dont follow some one else rules you become more strong and more smart person.

Fanally the last reason why you should be aonle is that no one is going to bother you you will make every thing in your hands and no some one else hand they will not be on your back bothering you you will make every thing posible on your hand and if you are alone you will become and expert on the jod,company,schools the things that you do you will be the head on your decitions and you are no going to use some one else head and if you use their head they will correct you in what you do and if you do is like from what they thing is better ithey will be bodering you and that is not to good because it will be bad why it will be bad? Because they will make where do you walk in a way that you must don't want to walk they will make every thing possible to walk in their way and you want to walk in your way thier will make every thing possible they will bother you and no yuo must follow your way and your road to make every thing possible to have your own experiences and your own rules.

Practicing is important because. One example is when I learn how to play soccer. The person that teach me was my cousin Im still bad but Im learning. Another Example would be when

I learn how to bould on fornite. I learn how to bould and sauces by my cousin. Lastly when I learn how to aim on fornite. I learn because of my cousin and he teach me how. Learning a skill Is better then not to.

I was waiting then got in the park and it was fun. In some cases Is better to be pation then not to.

Loaning a tik tok daced for me Is a skill. For example one dace would when I made my own dance. It was easy and I lorn. Another example would be a hard danced. I tried to duet but it was to hard so I quit. Lastly would be A danced that was hard but

I did step by step and I enjoyed. Loaning can sometimes be fun.

Practecsin is the way to success. An example would be a hard assignment that I did and it was hard. Second would be pattion when I need to.

Especially if they are important persons like friends,family,or girlfriend in those cases People get afraid to loose them or make them unhappy.

""JOHN LUBBOCK"" once wrote a amazing quote that speaks the true. ""your character will be what you yourself choose to make of it. that quote along changed my mindset, many people would disagree with John and his way of thinking but i personal agree with what he wrote,theres a lot of true behind his words, People shouldn't focus about others opinions or let bad experiences or events shape its character. I personal believe characters arent beyond our control after all we are the ones that control our way of thinking and reacting to them. My self has seen my tree closes friends Generic_Name,Generic_Name and Generic_Name ended up really bad after they decide to let bad events,experiences, and opinions shape the way of their characters.

Generic_Name one of my closest friend decided to let one big events shape his character and at the end everything went wrong for my dear friend. When he was a little kid he contently got hit by his parents in he grew up mad and he started using violence at school he would get in trouble all the time and his parents would get super mad and would use violence against him too they say it was to ""teach him a lesson"" everything went like that for him until many years passed and he got married and he contently used violence every time she did something wrong, he was mad about what its parents did to him so he would always hit his wife until one day he end up killing her and himself.

Generic_Name my other close friend let experiences shape his character in a bad way.

when he was a young man falling a love with pretty girls many of those girls just wanted to play with his feelings. Those girls never took him seriously until one day he got tired of the way girls would treat him and he loose feeling and he become just like those girls he didn't like at first. My friend Generic_Name started playing with girls feeling and he end up by him self and never finding true love, one he got true love but bad experiences make him loose feelings for all females and he played the one true love he had.

Generic_Name friend of mine let opinions got the best of him, he was contently trying to be someone he wasn't just so people he love would love him back but at the end he was just hurting him self because he wasn't happy like that he was just lying to himself and acting for other people.

people dont let bad experiences events or opinion to shape the character you yourself control or every one would end up like my friends that decided to let others control what they would have to.

2203,A46DA0EA4F5D,"Four-day School

Debate between benefits and disadvanges. Resume any doing school activities on regular five school day and change that for only four day.

To have a four-day school week, is an option that has to be adopted not only for some of the businesses workers and also by each high school and higher education school after see this reasons.

That is consisting of lose ten hour per week. but those missing hour can be recoup it by extending the school day two hour and increase the time for each class per day, that is an option to increase the atention and time on each class and complete any proyect or assigment toll by your teacher, and if we get the extra two hours, we can get more time with friends and teacher for suport between us on any class someone is failing.

Also, we can adopted an option for the fourth day on the extra two hours, used for time on the library, that can be amazing for the sturent who love reading, or students who love extra time on the sports, or any activity after school.

The fifth day of the week can be used for doctor appoinments or any health situations, you know the great excuse for missing classes on regular school time is because the parents write a note explaining we will be absent of some periods of classes. Doing any that situation on not regular time of school will deacrese the sturent missing on any period of class.

Without forget the teacher's situations who are the parents at the same time and need one extra day for family time and doing regular acctivities with their sons if that they have.

Don't forget the situations on seniors who are the most difficult situations on their life, decide for future, and they need time for keeping all option from universities and college for do the next step, higher education nad considered also job for weekends, also about freshman, who are the chlidren from middle school, they are the situation on needing understanding from extra activities on high school changed from their last rutine.

Another opctions for Friday or Monday free day can be used for community service, with permition of parent and some supervision of some adults, any students who wants participate on this can go and help on cleaning up street and river or any help on relation with community service, also the schools can create any program that consist on get many big companies who wants help students find a job on this new free day and may be part-time on weekend.

Considering:

Only four-day school, forget about the fifth day on school (No coming a little time for five days use the full time on four days)

three free days per week (use this extra time on family or friends meeting, any thing you and your parents want)

No wake up on Friday mornings or may be Monday mornings (dependes on the detition of the school about which day is going to be the third free day, use time for rest and complete responsabilities)

This idea can be not convenient for students with part-time job, because by following this model by extending the school day two hour will decrease the student's time sheet, even though if every one on this situation can use the fifth school day that will be free for a full-time job and get three full-time job.

Always remain. BE ON TWO DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES PER DAY CAN BE HARD AND EXHAUSTING, going school than going to work is exhausting because you don't have time for rest. But, if you get only four school days even though the school increase two hours you will have time after school for rest and doing any proyect or homework and use the other three days for any job you think is convenient.

Knowing disadvantages also remain the solutions and benefits for each disagreement on this proyect, because there are ore of the benefits than disadvantages for more 90 percent of the students.

After mention all points on considering benefits and disadvantages and solutions on that. To a four-day school week. Willingly I conclude with ""Everyone need a three day free from school and just four days on school"". Even though if any student's situation is diferent for using this free day, stay in home, family rutines, helping on home rutines, working or studing.

First, they can get distracted, In my position

I Can get distracted went I am at home doing homework i want to wache TV even some time I do not finish my homework because i get a lot distracted. I want to play whit my brothers go out side play soccer and i say just for a little I am to playing with then but a get distracted and i for got the i have to do homework or study for a test. Some time I get distracted by seeing my brother playing video even went they is a lot of noise i get distracted because i want to what is happening or what is going on. I remember one day the I have to finish a test review at home because I do not have time to do it at school I do not finish because I get distracted by brothers. They were making a lot of noise and i could no concentrate because of then. My brothers are the same way as me they can get distracted fully easy and not pay attention on what they doing maybe they star by doing they homework but they do no finish because they get distracted by the TV or the video game.

Second, they can use the telephone some time I get a lot distracted whit my telephone because I away want to be in the telephone. Went i home I just want to be in my telephone and i do not do my homework. I get fully distracted because I want to text whit my friends or playing video games in my telephone and not Du what i suppose to to do. Went I am at home I have all I want my bed my telephone the TV the I forgot the I have to how or study for a quiz or test. Only because I at home and I have all i need some time i do not want to do anything

I get distracted fully easy and more if I have my telephone in front of me because i want to leasing to music or video chat my friend and talk and pay attention on what I suppose to due. Some time my mom tell that I have to stuff in the house so I have to do it even if I am doing homework or studying I have to what she say and then a can kip doing what i was doing. If I have my telephone whit me the only thing i what to do is be in the telephone because it is a easy way to get distracted and not due what you suppose to due.

Some people my say that if students have home school it will be good because some students can get bully at school and they do not want to go back. The is say for then because some the students do not ride the bus the parent have to take then to school and the take a lot of time some time because they have to wait. Even they are going late for work and they do not have tame to take then to school. They may say the if they have school at home they do not have to do all the work by taking then to school. some time a lot of kids get bully at school and it more easy for then do do it by home because they do not have to deal with at school they do to have to be worry what would happen to then the net they or what does people are going to do whit then, But I chose to not have school at because some people can get distracted I not saying the all people have the problem I am just saying the i have the problem they my not have. But I do not like have home school because i want to see my friend graduate whit then have fun some time go to party and now more people have more experience.

have good relationship with your friends and make someone trust in you to tell their secret to you. Well that is what i think about Seeking multiple opinion.

Seeking multiple opinion can make someone trust in you. When someone trust in you, he or she can tell you their secret about everything they have in secret. If someone trust in you he or she will know that you are a good friend. For example,

if you do something wrong to your friend who trust in you, She or her is going to forgive you when you say sorry because, he or she trust in you. Being nice and respectful for example, not saying bad word to someone to be depressed, saying please when you are asking someone for something can also make someone trust in you.

Seeking multiple opinion can make you have good relationship with someone.

Having a good relationship with someone is a good thing to do in life.

Having a good relationship with someone can make him or her get close to you . Helping your friend for example, helping him or her with his homework or something he or she needs help with , advising him or her to do the right if he or her did something wrong, being nice and respectful to everyone can also make someone have a good relationship with you.

Seeking multiple opinion allow you to make new friends. Sometime when you are making new friends you dont just have to make friends, you have to think about it .

Make a friend who respect everyone, correct you when you do something wrong and someone who is there for you because, when something happen to and you have a bad friend, he or she will not help you but, If you have a good friend, he or she will help you when you are in a bad situation. Good friends are all way there for you when you have a problem with something or someone.

Well that is what I think about seeking multiple opinion. I hope you know some benefit of seeking multiple opinion . Whould you like to seek multiple opinion from different people ? I also hope you learn smoething from what I think about seeking multiple opinion.

People who stop and fail they don't learn from there mistake. The ones who fail and self believe they learn form past mistakes and try again. By practicing over time the person can understand the subject or the materials they'er trying to learn thats how some people can be successful. People who don't practice the won't get any where in life or get to there goals where they need it to be.

Winston Churchill say ""susses is consists of going to failure with out loss of enthusiasm"" yes i do agree with his saying. The reason being if you fail for an example on a math test you got an 53 but now this time on the retake you want to get a 80 now that's a goal you want to achieve. By practicing over time people can learn there mistakes from there past experiences and see how the develop over time. People who become famous, millionaires, and company owners they had good and bad ideas but they still became rich or powerful people by learning their mistakes. Winston Churchill is tilling us that by failure and believing in our self we can successful.

There are many ways to be successful to get where the person wants be to. The first step is were and how to start company or store. Second step is how to get the money, recourse, and a company to. Will the two steps are that easy,step number 1 always start off small use a room or make a stand out of wood if that doesn't come up with other ways. The second step buy the material off the item the cost mummers are buying if that a back fires you can always use you own money to buy the rests like company poster. Thats how some people can have bad or good ideas.

In conclusion people can be successful or not by learning the mistakes they make in the past. Finding a way of how people can practice there mistakes an be more productive in the future. Sitting a goals and having more of what you expected to have for example have a higher score on a math test. Having ideas and recourse to start small business.

3152,DE3867FD43DE,"well hello today I will discust the diferent between working wit a group or working alone first let me ask you a question how hyou like to? with a group or alone? well i chose working with a group lets see why...

working in group and working alone have advantages and disavantages for each one,I like wirking as a group because your team can help you with some ideas and ways to do your work and at the same time have fun while your are doing the work. disavantages in a group there will be always a person that want to be just playing around and don't like to do any type of work just have fun. nut if we being on the side of be working alone thant advantage will be that you will have more oportunity of do your work the way you want to and no be worry about other people opinion. you will finish your work faster and the way you want the wor kto be done,but some disvantages you will no have fun because you have no one to be with and it will be difficult to have a lot of ideas. i think working with a group is more beneficial because if you think there will be more people at the ppresentation helping you and you will feel more secure with your work.

working with a group can help you to increase your skill level of talking and self confidence and being social(meet new friends) , working alone can sometimes can get borring and you dont finish the work because you don't have someone to share the ideas with,

workingt alone can cause you a damage on yuor personalty and your aparetion people will think i he don't like workign with aother person around that he should work by it self andf then there will be a lot of caos that person fall in depresion because no one acept him and it was because you make them to be like that or feel that way.

while you are working with a group you learn skilll like having respect for others and diferentsd way of doing things and work as a team,or even for example you love play sport well you can not do it by your self because there will be team, and how you will work as a team with out learning how to work as a group, you need to learn how to work as a team if you want to be succesful in the comunity, in your future working with a group with the perople you trust you learn that friendship is alway good for you have thar confident that people you like being with help you to increase on your life that is a feel that no one can easy aford it.

went oyu are working with a group friendship will always be there why because is the keey of being succesful on your life. in your future, and your career, in your job.

for example;

lets said that you was driving on the higway driving normal but you forgot to past by the gas station you are in the middle of the street you don't have gas well if you don't like to work with a group then you will push your car and problably you will end up getting a desease or crashing another car.

while if you learn how to work as a group then you can have four people helping you push your car others stop the traffic and some calling the police to help you with that issue.

now you see why it is importan to learn and work as a group, even though with that you already meet new people and have new friend,what I try to said is that working with a group help you a lot in harders things that you need help with.

working alone is depent of what kind of personality you have and if you love working with out people than is fine but there will alway a time that you have to work as a team or group becasue there are things that someone by them self can not accomplish.

when you work as a group you gain respect and great friend ship because if you help with everything then everyone will love working with you and you now will feel that you are important and useful, something that working alone it will be dificult to make.

well i hope you like my explanation i did my best and i feel that we should be more socialize with other nad let then join us for our better future so they can have friends and they never feel like their are alone, lets make everyone happy and having a good time helping other and always respectful.",2.0,2.0,2.5,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.3,0

My grandma, always said that being in a group gives you more things to talk about. The benefits of working a group is more beneficial because,more ideas, partisan,and some one you can talk to.

Many calm that working alone will not share your ideas with other clearly, it better working in a group have fun and to talk to others.

To begin the benefits of working in a group is more beneficial because having more ideas. For example my sister, Generic_Name she loves sharing her ideas. Each ideas they share with they classmates. They can have have a example on what there writing about and have an idea on what there talking about. For example my Mom,is A fourth grad teacher she loves seeing others sharing it means a lot to her. She partners up the kids and so she, can see on thing the can come up with. However,having more ideas well help us share ans being thoughtfully to other in life.

In addishly,the benefits of working with group is more benefice because, to pertipat in a class room. For example when i first stared middle school i didnt want ti partisan with no on. Because, i wanted to work bye my self. Later that week i made a Friend and, she intrdust me to the other class mats, we all disided to be together for this school project. Example my little brother Generic_Name ,he was shy to talk to others in the class room. I as an oldest sister, to if him they no need to be shy just talk to others and pertipat in class and get to know every one. that next day my brother was happy to with others. However,partisan is a good way to show others an example and make new friends

Finely the benefits of working in a group is more beneficial because, having some one to talk to for example my friend Generic_Name, didnt have have nothing tot talk to for example my friend Generic_Name,didnt have nothing to think of .I was helping her on some thing we can together thinks of. I as a friend was there to listened to was she had to say. Example my other friend she wasnt at school because,her Grandpa, pasted away she misted on what we were working on. So i want to show her on the thinks she missed out. It helped her a lot.

2913,D242BBCBEAFB,"Some student can take classes at home because they could find a subject of course that like. Learning websites can help them get better at what they do. It could benefit because they it would seem easier to go on different classes or to take a video to study a subject. For example, taking classes online would give you a head start. Many other schools have students at home take taking these course and have them apply for it. It is like a benefit for them to take some opportunity to get taught about something they have learn or to have a different way of learning it.

I will think they would able to do this if they are interested. For example, Home-schooling could that much money. There could be some reasons for them.

1. They want to try out some different learning strategies.

2. They can apply online.

3. They can try taking some subjects that they like.

3417,EAB299C6ECED,"First Impressions are almost impossible to change this is true but they can also slightly change a little bit over time. I personally agree that is almost impossible to change an impression about someone so lets say that I agree and disagree because the statement is right but not everyone is the same, your thoughts and the way you think are different from everyone else, so the way you feel about a person could change over time. The first impression of a person about you could change over time just like your first impression about someone you've never met before could change as time passes and yall get know each other and hang out, go out to eat just like in a relationship, when the girl meets the guy and he looks so handsome, respectful, polite, nice, generous, very responsible from her point of view, when his at school, work, even when his home or even to the point of calling him sexy even if he is the skinniest guy ever you would tell him ""Wow baby, you're so sexy"", even if his not you would say it because you wouldn't want him to feel bad or anything to ruin that bond but when you guys start talking even more, start to hangout more often that bond will start to grow stronger in confidence and trust so when that time hits, It gives us a whole 360 degree spin now you start to be more open with your partner and you actually start saying the real things, Im not saying you have to lie but people in specific try to cover their lies with other lies and some times it dont even work or it don't add up at all but what Im saying is that when that right time actually hits you start being more open and you're not afraid and for the same the reason, you guys develop your ways up and work it out to the point of building a really strong trust, that confidence in you guy's eyes, that key to your heart and let everything be free.

It will take a while for you to see the prove but probably not to long but the results will come at one point and don't doubt it. however, with your first impressions you will represent yourself to the people or the way you act or the way you act in the beginning it will make them know if your child dish, immature, or the opposite.

If you put that respect and honesty in the beginning people will treat you with respect but if you like to mess with people yell at them without respect don't expect something else because it will come back to you and there's this verse in the Bible that I like that says "" what you plant, thats what will grow"" I don't think i wordily got it right how i said so what its meaning is if you're a lair don't be mad or don't ask God why is he doing this to you because that's what you planted in the beginning. When you meet a person what are the first impressions you get of that person on how they look, act and talk. When I first came in Generic_Name class and actually met her, my first impression was she's very nice, knows how to properly talk to students and as time pass I got my points proved right.

I agree with this statement, because the time passes in your life is going with it, the more you do the more you get and that is what people don't get, if you want to make accomplishments in your life you have to worked out man, For example Lebron James how do you think he went where he is now, Making steps in his life, goals, family help, you have all of it it is right there you just have to get it.

""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else""... honestly I will not take it like is changing you, because you are the one changing your life, yes you will be seeing stuffs you will make some errors but that is how you are going to reach what you want in life. you are going easy you will get it easy and you will get it shipper too, if you work hard at the first time, at the end it will come easy and you will be thanks full.

A great accomplishment?, That can be anything, every one is a world, what I mean by that is that every mind have the power to do what it have to be done, either a teacher, family, friends, they are just telling you where is the door, your friends are not going to opened for you, not your parents or teachers, you are the one who will opened if you want to do it and get out, and get that goal or accomplishment that you have to complete.

I can be a example for this, I used to hate school a lot, i went tot his time that i didn't wanna even go there, but there was this English 10 teacher that just speaking with me one day just one day, yes I was having F at that moment, after all that thinking a lot about what she said I passed her class at the end with a B, not knowing that I was going to be able to do it, but I did it just doing what i have to do, like I said people can just tell you where is the door you have to go get it.

389,1D8BDC81DE2C,"What does it mean to partnerships with a companies? I think it a good ideas for Many students who look for opportunities before they go to collega. Student will get to explore certain work area and what type of work they want to do. If student want to work at a company they can visit the company and see what kind of work they do. If school partnership with companies it will help many students to choose what type of work interest them. I think they should select me because I like to be around people, I want to know what type of jobs I want to do, and I want to have a experiment about jobs.

There are so many people who don't like to be around, but I really like to be around people. I think when I am around people It give you a postive feeling. Anywhere you work or go and your around people It alway give you postive feeling. If you work in a company there will be people that you have to work with even if you like them or don't. One time at my school we were in a group project and I didn't know the people who were in the group and I didn't know what to say. Then I started talking to them and now we are friends. Whenever I am around people even If I don't know them and when I start talking to them I feel like I know them for long time.

So many student alreadys know what they want to do in future, but I don't know yet what should I do. I always ask myself that what I am good at. I never figure it out what is something I am good at. I think not someone can get the jobs they want ,but If they select me to It will give me the opportunities to find out what types of work I am interesting in. It will really help me If I know what work I want to do. There are many people who are not happy with their jobs, but they still have to do it for their family. I think people should choose what jobs they want to do.

If I want to work at a company and I don't know anything about the company how can I work there. I think before you work you should have a experiment so you know what is the jobs about. I wanted to work at a resturants, but I didn't know what kind of work will they have so I ask my friend who have work there. If you don't have experiment you can research about it. There are work where you don't have to have experiment, but in some jobs they want you to have a experiment. I always wanted to be a nurse so I always wanted to learn about nursing. If I get select I would have a opportunities to explore about nurse and I will get to have a experiment.

However you should not select me, but you should because I like to be around people, I want to know what type of jobs I want to do, and I want to have a experiment about jobs. I like to be around people because I think it give a postive feeling.

2246,A828480AA508,"Successes comes in so many diffrent whays,but the real questchon is how can having a good attitude lead you to being more successesful in life. I think that starts with your attitude ,attitude plays a big part in your life, for example if your about to take a really big test in math class and you tell yourself befor the teast that your going to fail and your just having a negtive attitude about it, your more likely to fail ,but if you walk into math class with a good attitude and your cofdent in yourself and your just going to give it your beast I thinkyour more likely to pass the teast.

When you think of successes you think of famos people you might think of a person on tv or someone that hass lots of money. If you think about it the people you wach on tv or any of the people you think are successesful hade to have strugled in life to get to the place they are now. What ever the strugle was they hade to get back up and push themself. There are successesful people every where fot example it could be your mom, or your dad, brother, sister any one you know. Successes doesnt have to be a big thing it could be you doing something like running a mile or being the first person in your familly to go to college or just geting all As in school Whatever it is having a good attitude in life can really change your life.

I try to be as successesful as I can if thats in school I try my beast,Whatever it is I know I cant acomlish anything without a good attitude. For example in the fuetre I want to be a fashon disinor, but that whount hapen for years but thers things I can do to push myself to the thing I want to do. Things I can do now to get to my futer ,I can start with a postive attitude There are hatters every where that try to bring you down you just have to learn how to ignore them and learn how to creat a path for yourself.",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.0,2.5,0

Thired state park:

in the state park it's more qiuter than national park, less people comnceting and give each other ideas to do a project envolving any subject.

Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it.'Do we choose our own character traits ,or is our character formed by influences beyond our control.

Although some people think that character is formed for other persons that are around them and that their character is always going to be formed for people around them but character is formed by the way of your own emotions that shows how you feel how you are, other people says that if they don't be like other people want to they be they feel out of the group in that moment some people starts to hate their self, but what other people do is they ignore what people says about them as they don't hear anything and never give up.

Other people think that if they don't change their character they are going to success in their life and that they are obligate to change for they future and when they change they start to feel bad because they change something better than what they get and when other people ask them for what they change they says that for be an adult they have to be like one but what is a adult is a is a person that looks death and is always mad with other people or they say that the character is formed from the moment they born and that hey can not do anything about it .

In my conclusion, We choose our own character and it's doesn't have nothing with others person ,we choose how we wanna be and how we feel better with our self...

These days happen and it's sometimes gonna be annoying and one thing can not ruin your day. Their could be a day that you get a good grade on your test and you feel happy for yourself, but then you still have a bad grade. People always have some smile in there face and the other people think that their having a good day which they are, but in the inside you don't know what happen.

There are some people that make other people days. Some people have feelings for other people and they get sad when they have a good day, but then they have a test to do which they don't wannna do. Their are even dogs that make people days, but they still think about the difficult time that they had today. People forget what their doing but then remebers what happen. Difficult time happens and you can't help It only If have a good attitude.

Their are sometimes that people have a great day but at the end something bad happens and there were your day is bad. Sometimes people don't like difficult time like stressing out, had a fight, got caught doing bad things, but they still smile becasue there trying to forget about that and think about something better.

I am tired to use all this drogas, i want to be something else in my life. Since this moment he chenged his life. Now he wanna be a doctor for to help people to become a some else in their life. I am agree with Emerson's statement about individuality because i can demostrate that they said is wrong, to show them what is defference between to make and to talk, and to be concetrate. Those thing i can show the people that i can doing with myself and that make me a greatest accomplishment.

I feel to be myself, it is not depend what people said about me. If i want to change or to be something else in a world, i have to do what my mind say to me, for example if i wanna be a teacher. And they tell me to be a teacher is not important because their payment is trash, they just can earn $1000 each months. But if i like to be teacher do not matter what i earn. They will trying to make me confuse. Maybe they already tried it, but they could not do it , that is why they believe that i could not do it either but not all time is the same, the world change every day so i need to try to show them that what they said it, it was wrong. So it is important do not pay attention people who try to make me confuse.

Also there are two defference between to make and to talk because i can believe in myself but if i just talk and to say i will do this, i will do that and i will not doing nothing. That way i can help the world even i lie myself. But if i did not said none and to show people that i change my life with my attitude. they will come at me and ask me what happend with me? because i am changing. I will tell them that i want to be something else in a world. That will be my greatest accomplishment.

Even if i believe in myself i need to be concentrate because i am human and i am not perfect, i can fail with my decision if i am not concetrate. Because bad people will like to see me on ground they will tell something fun that i missing. For example to study, many people do not like to study because they say that school is boring so that i am doing they believe that is boring. They will try to convence me doing wrong things so i have to demostrate them that i wanna be something else in a world not just have fun.

In conclusion, work individuality is not easy i have

To showto the people that sometime we do not need help from somebody else. Just believe in myself, do not heard what they said about me, to show them what is the defference between to make then to talk and all time to be concentration in what i am doing.

Being enspired by someone to do that instrumet or what ever you want to do you need somone to motivate you for example, their was this one time where my brother motivated me to play the chello and I did and it felt good,because I practiced everydaycand I loved doing it. Thats why practicing is important.

Having fun while playing in band or orchestra your able to travel to diffrent states to learn how difrrent groups play,

learn diffrent songs, and learn the sites of that certain city. Thats why I joined orchestra when I was about 9-10years old I learned about 20 new songs that 1 school year and I loved doing it. It was fun to watch, and hear them while playig it was probably the best year i had in 3rd grade.

The people in your group are like your family you guys are going to travel together and perform together. And even making freinds to the new kids who join later in the year so dont worry about being left out while traveling to that certain state your always going have someone to talk to be around.

1157,5985EA6F171A,"I think is a good idea that the students start thinking about what they want to study in the college, what they want to be in the life, and they start preparing for the future in the high school. It is a good idea because they can start working when they are really young, It is a good idea too because they can make money when they are young, It is a good idea because they can buy they own things with their own money, like a house, a car, or whatever they want, and they can get graduate really young and that is the way to prepare you for something.

For example you can stop living with your family you can be indepent, nobody can tell you anything you can rent your own room just for you and you can have your own space, another example is that you are young maybe you make a wrong decision in the career that you choose but the good option is that you are young you already did the high school maybe you already work so you have money you can start another career more important something that these time you already liked because you are more older you know more about what you really want. Also in the work that you have you can study a little bit more and you can scale to another position too much better when you are young you're body don't feel so tired when you work because you have more energy, but when you are more older your body start feel tired, you start loose energy the sickness come your body hurt you have to go more to the doctor, so when you are young you can work more for you retirement.

In conclusion is a good idea that the students start commit a career at a young age because that are going to help them to be someone in the life, also that are gonna help them to be an important person. But the more important is that you are going to work in what do you love to do. The benefit of start preparing for a career since the high school is that you are going to be a young with a lot experience, also that help to the young students stop thinking on bad things, like cigar, tobacco, alcohol etc. Also help them keep their mind busy and to be in high school and not in the streets with bad friends that help them to keep a educational way. And is something that they are going to use in the life and is something that is good, what we need now is a societies based on education because that is a good thing because the education come with a lot of opportunities and with that opportunities the students can lear a lot, the learning is the best thing on the world.",2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,0

Students who commit to a career at a young age always doing better things in them life, and when students get a old age he or her always know what they have to do because they trust their work when they was young.

Ex: Generic_Name said, when she was a young, she was trust her things and it was always teaching her many thing and shows her what to do and how to be, and many people was care about her, they was not doing them things without her, when they want to do their things, they was waiting her because she was help them and teaching their, and she get an achievement in her life, and reach her goal.

2267,A9A6B5A288DC,"Should some people believe in praising a student's work to build self-esteem, even if the work is not the student's best effort. They believe that students must be self-confident in order to learn. I agree with students must be self confident because its better to grow in life then stay in the same place over and over again. If a student does not believe in what he or she can do then that student will not be able to compete things in that student's life time. Also a builds a great mindset for the student to keep moving forward. Students should have self-esteem for a successful life.

If a student doesn't believe in what he or she can do then that student will not be able to compete things in that student's life time. Student that doesn't think that their capable of doing more that student will stay the same and would not be able to grow, also that student self-esteem will lower down. Another thing a student should getting moving up and high than he or she can do is there are no limits in what that person can do if the student knows that they would be able to do what they can do they can easily grow by practicing more and believing they can do it. So by not believing in what he or she can do that will affect what will happen later in life, never stop believing in what he or she can do as a student.

Building a great mindset for the student to keep moving forward. To have a good self-esteem the student will have to set up goals to show to their self that that student can do more. Another thing after writing down their goals is which one will they do first or which one is do he or she want to compete first. With all the choices to choose like for example: goals, friends or family that support, or how will is the student want to succeed, because even if they don't try as hard as they know how to it could happen to anyone in life that shouldn't make a student to stop trying it should make them feel like okay it wasn't my best my first time he or she can get the second time because a student should always chase what they are willing to have. Building a great mindset for the student to keep moving forward is good for a student to have a great self-esteem. The reason students should be praising for their self-esteem is, because no students should say no to even if it's not their best work the first time everyone should have a chance to have a great self-esteem and to keep growing in life.",2.5,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.5,2.4,0

If the curfew adopt the teenagers, the situation will change to the better. the council said the teenagers don't have to be in the street after 10 p. m. in the weekdays because they want the teenagers out of troubles. and they found teenagers in the street after 10 P.M. that's mean is breaking the law. that warning for the people because sometimes the bad people walk around have a knife or have a gun these people can kill someone kidnapping anyone. Or someone make a bomb and try to put it in street. and also is danger because maybe someone drank a lot and he drove the car maybe can hit anybody by the car that's why the police check the city a lot of time to make sure no bad things will happen and also the police check the city because if someone have something wrong they will help them. if the teenagers don't break the law this will help the police to try make the city safe the safety in city is so important. Like example that happen with me when I was 15 years old I was walking in the street at 11 p. m. and I was going to my home I see one man behind me but I thought is regular man but he was have a knife and he said to me give anything you have I was have my wallet had on it my ID and not too much money and I don't have anyone in the street to help me and he took my phone and he told me leave and don't look behind you I ran away because he was almost gonna kill me. be in your home early to be safe. The police doesn't want to control on you but he want to be safely. because the world is not safe now the world have a lot of bad people. And also I was have my friend was in street at 1 a. m. and someone was drank and hit my friend by the car. And my friend is dead all of these to show you how the world is not safe. the police have a lot of situations with the bad people. and if you look at the countries is not safe the reason is because every day around the country you will find everyday someone killed. That's tells you how the world is not safe. a lot of people dead because of the people is drank or the someone have a gun or knife. if you search in internet about the people is succeed in their life the internet will show you these people focused in their future when they finish their work the going to their home to take a rest. try to make your schedule early like in the mid day in the morning to go to your home early.

Wilnston churchill, he say that success in life or anyother things, theres a failure and don't lose enthusiasm because of that litlle things or because you fail one time in your try.

I agree with the minister churchill say because succsee it's a way to improve your skills or be betther in what you did and you try to not haves more make mistakes annymore, success can have failure but also you can lern for them, and learn how to rersolve your pronlemsand see how far you can go by trying, how you can have more expiriense by traying and traying again and again, no making mistakes annymore so the next time you don't have the same mistakes or pronblems because you larn about it.

I think with success you can learn a lot of experiance in your life, because with your failure you learn about it, because if you leave it like that you not trying and you are not exploing your self, so if you exploit your self you can see how far you can go to resolve the problems or the mistake you have.

So if you explod your self trying more and more you can maybe resolve the problem or see how far you can go to find a solution, the thing is if you keep trying your best in somthing you don't know exacly what it is or how to resolve it in many times you can find a solution and fix it.

failure is not you are not going to resolve it because if you are doing your best but you keep failure is becuase you need to find the problem you are not seeing, to resolve it failuture is not because is not working success is because you didn't find the solution at your problem.

For my conclusion for success you have to pass for a lot of problems and mistakes so you can find a solution for it, in your life if you don't explow your self you won't know what was the problem to that but if you explow your self you can find the solution and also learn from that, trying hard and hard moust of the times you can find a solution for evryting and that is how you also you can help others with they problems like when they say two heads is better then one.",2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.2,0
2253,A8D0ADC676C0,"Everyone would eventually ask an advice if they need help on a particular subject or ask for an opinion if they ever get confuse. Advises or opinions would solve one's problem. For example, to prevent making poor choices or decisions, to determine which advice is accurate, and to allow someone to feel secure with choices. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.

First, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice by preventing making poor choices or decisions. For instant, if someone attempts to steal. If there's something you want but it's expensive. Also, if someone gets in a fight. If there's someone you don't like or disagree with. Lastly, if someone lies. When someone did something wrong and lied about it. Seeking multiple opinions can help some make a better choice.

Furthermore, seeking multiple opinions can help people make a better choice by determining which advice is accurate. For example, to be sure that it's reliable. If many said the same thing while others said a different thing. Also,if someone wasn't sure about the advice. Ask people for more advice if the advice is inaccurate. Lastly, if the advice is inaccurate. If someone said one thing while others said the other thing. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.

Finally, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice by allowing someone to feel secure with choices. For instant, if someone gets confuse. If you're lost on one subject. Also, if someone gets lonely. if someone doesn't have a baseball team. Lastly, if someone gets worried or afraid. If someone you know is absent or gone. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.

In summary, viewing many opinions can benefit people to make a better choice by preventing making poor choices or decisions, determining which advice is accurate, and by allowing someone to feel secure with choices. I believe that asking yourself for advice is also necessary. but, viewing many opinions from people is probably more necessary than viewing your own advice.",2.0,2.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.3,0

When you constantly trying to make you something you learn something that you don't know; something that surprise you because you never think that you can do, and you say I can do that thing and I want to experiment more things spontaneous because is better when that things have spontaneous because left better and so cool and impressive to you. Experiment more things new help you to be better every moment, to that these for you can helped an others persons when they need our help, when meet with one situation where somebody need help motivate that he or she can do it nothing is impossible, because a lot of peoples in the world don't believe in their self because all that time suffrage bullying they thing that they don't serve for nothing they believe in that bad words, is for these reasons that one situation appear in front of our eyes helped, spoke with love,respect,be courteous because when you spoke with one persons that have these problems where suffrage bullying, bad words that others peoples say they feel miserable have hatred,resentment and all of times they don't want to talk, you need or our need to going to these peoples and spoke with love, love is one of the most good gun that we have is the most important in that around world.

The first reason is the older students give a advise to the younger students, the older student are helping with the younger students because when the older student are giving advise to the younger student make them intelligent for example when i was in elementary school in fifth grade my principle asked my teacher to give information or to give idea to the third grader on their project and my teacher sand us to the third grade classroom and my classmate was helping with the third graders.

The second reason is to help them make more understandable on their subject, the older students are trying to make the younger students more knowledgeable in their subject. for example when i was in sixth grade the my best friend was in seventh grade when i needed help with my homework or with same other classes homework and she was always helped me with my homework, testes, and quizzes and i was getting more understandable in my every subjects and she teached me how to solved problems.

My Teacher Wanted me to Share a Lesson With Elementary Students

.

Next, I told The Students, What I was going to present to Them. it's very Important to Speak With The Students About Something interested That They Would Love, to hear About. I told The Students What They Want to be when they grow up, They said I

Want to be a Police Officer one Day. The other one said He Wanted to be a fighter fighter. And I told Them to Become a police officer or a Fighter Fighter They need to graduate high School And Get a Degree For College And Take Those Classes, to have a Good Job for The Rest of Their life's. Finally When My Presentation Was Almost over Suddenly' The Students Ask me Those That I'm going to Take Do I have to Past Those Certain Classes to Get my Degree, Also I Said it's Not That Easy to Have Your Dream Job That You Want. You Have to Work For it And Earn it And Try Everything You Could We're You Want to Be. Motivate Your Self, Push Your Self If You want Your Career that you want Then, Always Believe in Your Self When You Have a Dream Career Don't Give up on it. When You Give up on Something You're Not Going To succeed in Life. I'll Tell My Self To Get Back Up On Your Feet And Chase Your Dream. But in Life there's No Second Chance. Last, When You Finally Acheive Your Dream Job You Can Thank Your Self for Believing in Your Self and Working, Hard every day. because After All The Struggle, You Been Putting Your Self to Succeed And That's Why you Are We're at And Always Chase Your Goals to Succeed.",3.0,2.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.5,0

First i want to be something in the the future i will choose my won character, second i will choose my won character to be socialize with people and third i might chose my won character to take care of my health.

First i want to be something in the the future i will chose my won character. For example; my parents wants me to follow what they wants to make my character but i'm not agree with their decision, they wants me to be a doctor in the future but, i want to be a pilot in the future, so i will decide my won character to be a doctor or a pilot and i would choose what is best for me.

Second i will choose my won character to be socialize with people. For instant; I love people! spending time with people around me helping me to learn how to build my won character better, being socialize with people mean you have more friends and spending time with them can help me to learn new things from them and experience them might help my won character.

Third i might choose my won character to take care of my health. whoever health is more important to me, health is depend on my won character ,for example; if i eat healthy food it's can help my mind to think about my won character, if my health is not good i won't be able to follow my won character so, we should focus more about our health,so we can be able to choose our won character in conclusion, it is true that your character will be what you yourself choose to make it. i want to be a pilot in the the future i will chose my won character,spending time with people around me helping me to learn how to build my won character better and if my health is not good i won't be able to follow my won character.

94,06FA8EF28227,"Many people in the history of the world were important because they become who they want to be, and now society try to persuade people from who they are and change to what they want, to be your self in a world that is constantly traying to make you something else is the gratest accomplishment, also you decide who you want to be

I agree with this because some times parents try to change their children, also school making decision for their students, religion first point parents trying to change their children, in some cases parents try to persuade their children from what they want to do or from what they want to be on the future, if some one of their children want to play soccer and if their parents do not know everything about soccer they search anything they just say no and they make their children to try something different or if the child do not want to go the place that they are going most of the parents do not listen what their sons want or like and also sometimes parents make their children to be what they do not what to be in some cases parents tell they children that they need to play an instrument liket the guitar but maybe that child wants to play the drums. some famous people are unhappy because their parents make them to become famous but maybe that child do not want to do that.

second point some times school makes decision for students too some times students do not want to take some classes and school choose for them, in some parts students do not like to wear uniforms and they make them to wear it, in case that you came from other country and you do not speak the same language you need to be able to learn because if you did not do it you are not able to be in the school and if you do not understand what are they talking about is hard but you need to be like them because you do not have people who speak the same language as you do, so you have to be part of something even if you do not like it third point religion is there to try to change your mind they are many religions in the world but all depends if you want to choose one of those religions but some times people try to make you part of that religion and some times you change completly of who you was if that work for you is perfect but if not you are going to be completly different person, you need to dress different at you usual do, and also they tell you what is wrong and what is not wrong even if you did not do anything wrong they think that and they always want you to belieb things that maybe are not true but why we need to follow that and why we need to beliebe that, so if you want to do something do that thing because you want it not because someone tells you.

In my opinion I agree with what Albert Emerson wrote because to be our self in this world that is constantly traying to make us something else is the greatest accomplishment, is hard to be our selfs because people are always traying to tell us about what we are going to do because for the society what they do is good but maybe you have a different idea but most of the time you need to do what they tell you to do the best accomplishment is being ypour self and being what you want to be and if you want to do something just do it and do not listen about what other people say or what they think because people are never happy with the things that you do.

161,0C30A2A5D998,"It success consists of going from failure? I think that there are people that are successful and have gone through failure because without experiences people will not know that is out there. I believe that in live there is gong to be up and down and this teach us who to be an successful person.

First,to have a successful live we need the experience to be success not matter who many obstacle we have. When I was eleven I star making cookies at first I was bad, and when I fail the first try, but I keep going to make cookies not matter how bad I was. Then as I keep failing, and one day I was able to be successful. People have to know that we are not perfect and in some point of live we have to be unsuccessful to became what we one to be some day, Also it very important that people have the capability to say that they have make mistake.

Second,people have up and downs. As an example J.K Rowling she wrote the Harry Potter sires,and she want it to published,but she was not successful,and then by the time her sires was one of the most famous book. I believe that any one can be an successful person,but they have to know that not every thing is going to be a success at the first try.

Other believe that success is not consisted in failure because they think that people can be successful with out making any mistake. Thinking that every thing is easy as an litter kids puzzle.

In conclusion failure is one step of been success because every person can process the piece that their missing to be successful. As people have been going in up and down,and had experiences who thing are going.",3.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.5,2.5,0

So you don't think that to be mistaken is wrong, but if you make a mistake, try to don't do it again. I give you a example: If you are on a game (football,soccer,basquetball,etc), so if you are on any game and your time is lose, but you know the wron in the other team, so you know that you can attack on this wron and you can won the game, or if you lose that game but you got the revenge, well now you know where is the wrong and maybe your team won the game.

here are reason why they should be achievement .

achievement for student more hard working than praising student . for example let say you are try to work very hard if the teacher praised to student the student going to give up the work or get so upset . student needs achievement to more work done.

praising is not a bad thing. so this is why people should pick an achievement .

let say you wanna make students to do some project for about how to draw an art . if one of them succeed on their project and other one praising him it will not make sense for them . but if you active them that will be their for history of their school years.

and lastly achieving the student makes them more happier than praising the student . because may the get high points or good grade (A or B) or better than praising the student .i should say self-esteem comes from achievement .

Also students help their parents taking care of their sibling after school, some times also students help their parents at home as clean the floor, wash dishes, make dinner and time for their hobbies, made the life of the students more easy at schools and at home.

students that like to do sports after school as soccer, fotbool, basquelbal, or tennis, some just wants to have a little time of peace by themselves as reading or walking alone those little thing is what a student can miss but if teachers decide to extended the schools to hours late, students also are going to work the same amount of time the only different is that they have to work to hour more each day to complete the forty hours work for week, and those two hours would private students to do what they like to do and make the life more happy.

The other companies can check the books and the games in the large screen because they builded the large screen with their technology and they can speaking with other person and it's important to help to the person with their comunication because we need to learning about to the new tehnology that they builded and the employee need to brings good ideas for the boss for to do the games more better with the new technology.

with the other technology new they can show the books in the other companies and they need to do activite with the other employee then the need to have good life and they need to do vacation for relax for that have good ideas the employee to have access for get more better the games because they want to build good games for the persons the employee need get something that can they to do idea they can work with the other person that they can to do good work.",2.0,2.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,3.0,2.4,0

I disagree imagination is more important that knowledge.

I disagree because, I think knowledge it's more important because, you have to knowledge after you imagine because, I think knowledge it'a more important because you have to knowledge. The situation to think really good if you dont due you can not think what it's gonna happen.

because if you only imagine you don't gonna knowledge good because, if you only imajinate and say the words after you knowledge the words you what to says. and if you knowledge first after think you can be able to due son tings.

If you gonna to due a story if you only imagine you can not be able to due because you have to Knowles the situation first after you think because son times you can get good imagination and you have to knowledge.

like for example if don't knowledge you don't gonna now were put tings to knowledge the situation were you gonna put things and the ca n be better.

I don't no what scientists Albert Einstein think and i gonna now what he thinks because, people have different opinion like how it's more better to they can use, and because persons have different ideas,like me i think then knowledge it's more important, then imagination but others people they can think it'snot because for people to see things it's different, because if the person am gonna write the story am gonna use the knowledge to knowledge, the situation better and make good story.

The knowledge it's like then a group because you have to search or knowledge to now what you gonna due because, if you only have in a imagination to what you gonna due that can work, like when you go to your job and you have to knowledge,what you gonna due for the day.

when you go to school and you go to science if you have to examine the a plant you have to knowledge the plant to now were you can star to examine the plant.

when you due sometimes you have to knowledge the situation,like for example,when a person quilled to another person, the police they have to knowledge,the scene and who was the criminal and knowledge the situation how died and who was .

some people think the imagination it's was first and it's more important would, I think the people see for different forms to due would a think some people it's right because, I see for different forms like when you imajinate it's like when you imajinate the things would you can have a picture in your minds like you can see pictures like were you what to put things.

but you can have im imajine in your mied but you have to knowledge first because i think if you knowleged because i feel more necesary to knowleged beause when you knowledged you can feel it's more easy or if you look like the pictures way it's more easy, because you see the things more specific en your miend.

it's alot ways to you can see things because for people some people looks diferets to others you can see more better in you way if you don't get.

First, the students has more distraction in home; with vedeo play, and othe oction, more students work a time with taking a class, more with have a classes in distance, the schools need a tanking a other options. With lern in school the students are more specific learn, with a have a teacher opposite the student to learnig more specific, when she tanking the classes to has a more effective for a students.

Second, I hink this option for learning offer the class in distance wich a attend classes from home; not is a good option for example: in my house a have three brothers, and one sister, I think is distraction wich learning in home.

In finally; with reason with not is good idea the learning a distance the school, I think is more elementary, basic to taking the video conferencing online, because; learning more in the watch the vedeo conference, with online; is more effective memorize with the morning in not in evening, the students have forceful in the morning, but no think this is a good option for a students, not have a good benefit from being able to attend classes from home.

If your school extend school day for two hours there are some thing you can't do. You can't play after school games. You can't do your homework. You have less time to work. You going home late. You can't fresh your mind.

Reason one, students who work after school they have moer time on work. For example, if your working time is four o'clock to ten o'clock. If you work regular time you going to make more money. Students need to work becaus they needs to pay the cell phome bills or on gasolin.

Reason two, students who want to play after school game they can play the game. If they don't have time to play after school game they can't fresh there mind. For example, students who live one or two hours away for school they have time to play after school game.

Reason three, students can fresh there mind. Students can't fresh there mind because they are studying more then they need. For example, some time students can't remember what they learn in class, but can do other thinks. Some time student haveing so much fun in the class. Because there mind is so much fresh.

some reasons why they should know more aobut a career at younger age are:

They will be ready after they graduate and know'ing what are they gonna do.

It will be more easy after you graduate you don't have to worry about what career are you gonna study,

and it ognna make you more responsible.

Some students don't like this idea to be guide at a younger age they don't want to worry that much,

some student just want to finish high school firts and they have 4 years to decide what are they gonnna do after high school and what career are they gonna pick.

3674,F65622698950,"Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing""?

I believe, when most of the people don't understand how relevant is to do something instead of being inactivity that also serve purpose because like everybody else it is normal to always do or make good things for someone, and it could be family or close friends for example.

My reason is if we try to done good stuff for people, and not receiving anything back for example: If I give people chance to not try anything, then how are we gonna communicate? how are we going to accomplish our goal when you don't deserve it? so my point and my reason is the we need to do something about not being inactivity with people are around you. I understand that not everyone are gonna have the same thoughts as me or with other person. However we need to be on the side to the change for good.

I grew up knowing when people put a lot of their afford to you, it means a lot because you'll never know when people will trust you and believe in you again it's a huge difference between those, and we people show us or make us see how important is when almost everything is easy when we ask for it example: Trying to hard to show how many things you have done for that person without asking, but it means a lot to you because you give a lot to that person and you hope that person can give you the same thing you've done for her or him.

Sometimes some people misunderstood about always doing something for her or him like you don't have to do it for them, but believe you'll feel great if someone do something for you isn't a bad thing then you will be fine and grateful knowing that theres good people around you, and ready for help you. You ain't alone anymore believe theres people for you and try to not think too much about it.

My conclusion is about to always do something for people because there is people who will need you, and being around, and everything you want to do for them it will make it better like. Thomas Jefferson wanted to do good stuff as a president caring about his people, and making him one of the best presidents, so it is wonderful to done much for them than yourself.

Having a specific career while being young student would make the student more responsible and creative of what he is going to do for his life with full of confidence, because in growing up more hard decisions the student will have so he has to choose the right decision, being creative at his career will let the student get a big succeed, and being already chosen a career is enough by itself to stay away of the people who failed in their life because they dont have a goal or career they can get.

2286,AAE16C990870,"To begin with, I am going to be listing my reasons on why i agree to the statement that the former British prime minister winston churchill said. In each paragraph I will be supporting my reasons.

To start off with, My first reason on why i agree with the statement Is because their Is always a saying that says keep trying don't give up. When i read this statement I see that saying because you can't give up you got to keep trying to get what you want.

Second, With the statement saying ""success consitts of going from failture to failture' I agree with just for the smiple fact that In life you will go through some rough times and you may not always succeed In what you are trying to do or accomplish, because someone will always fail at something they are trying to accomplish but will keep trying because at some point they will complete what they had tried to accomplish the whole time.

Last, Someone can't lose hope of trying to complete something because they will complete it. They have to stay motivated to keep on going and keep on going to complete it. Everyone will be successful but If someone just gives up and doesn't keep trying then they won't get what they wanted to accomplish. Some people don't know that enable to succeed they will fail at it plenty of times but they would have to keep trying to succeed at it and can't lose hope.",2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,0

In my opinion I think it would be great for the health of the school and student to have a healthy food during school hours, one main reason is bacause it keep our body,healthy strong in which we can reflex our education, It will benefit all the students mainly the ones that are in PE class,eating healthy can improves more day of life and better human body, eathing halthy can prevent you from disease and probably some virus.

by eathing healthy you will not only will be able to be on a good fit you can also feel good and with feeling good about your self means more thant anything in this world, my opinion about this i agree with this change and i would like to see more plans for the upcoming futre years.

every plas have good and bad opinions many student at school have said and have their own opinion, Many of them dont like to eat halthy they just wnat to eat and enjoy their life at the fullest, which is reasenable and i undestand they point, we all know that the food that make our body get fat and get worse is the bad type food but we all love that kind of food, is delicius and it taste great for example pizza, hamburgers and all those kidn of food.

To keep a balance and for the students to be better and feel better about them self i think it will be the best to have a schedule of food for example :monday healthy food, Tuesday bad food...

In my opinon i thik it will be the best for our students and for everyone in the school to have a healthy food schedule that way we can be happy and satisfy with our body. I agree with the plan of replacing the school food for a healthy kind of food. thanks for all your pation and i hope you like my opinions and you could consider this on your future plans.",2.0,2.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,3.0,2.4,0
2730,C8EBB096262B,"To Begin with, many student have many excuses to not attend school. Of curse, that we can change this to not be happen anymore. Student may not complete the school if they lose the year.

What would happen if student get affected for all student that not attend school? For example, like I seen in me that I have a lot of appointment that is affecting me and my grade. We can not let this happen we need to do many thing in order to not let our child lose. In addition,

principal should offer distance learning for student that the way could not affect them because student might have a natural disaster in their neighborhood, student might be sick in such manner that could not attend school, that might affect their grade and they might repeat the year.

First reason, student might be absent for a reason like to be sick in such manner that could not attend school. All included student that is special that they go for a week or more in the hospital. Moreover, student sometime the doctor let a lot of appointment for them to check up or appointment with the dentist. Also, student who have allergies when the weather change they got affect in that they may not come to school. In high school, student sometime they get pregnant and the doctor let them many appointment including when they delivery they lose many school days and that affect many student lose the year or they may get affect their grade. Because we don't know in the future what will happen to some of our student that many of them don't find any solution of their problem. In fact, we don't know what it will happen if we don't give an opportunity to our students. We must pay attention to them if they lose many days of school sometime they are afraid to talk about their problem.

Second reason, student in their neighborhood might have a natural disaster also might need the distance learning in order to not lose school days. Sometime the weather get so angry that may bring accident or can bring tree crashing in our hose or may get rain and rain that could bring floating that may cause a lot of problem to some our students. In addition, the school bus may not get as in order to come to school. If it a student that walk that student could not get to school and the County could not cancel the school or even in there's no light and that may tell an announcement that student could not get informed about the school information weather. Because, if student get that problem the principal could not believe and it can not give an chance to those student to take the test or the exam that they had in class. After all, in the school no one care about you even if you have a teacher that it is so inpatient.

To end with, the school should offer the distance learning to some of our students. Student may got sick for a little reason and if they had natural disaster, we should care about it. If we find a student that always is absent we should ask them what is the matter or what is the problem with them? While some may argue that if we offer the distance learning student may not lose school days and even they could not lose their grade student could have benefit from this way student could not lose, however some may argue that if we gave the distance learning to student student could not enjoy this learning they just will playing even if we give the distance learning in computer they just see it they they will start playing video game or they just will watch a video.

i think some of student want to go help the community and some of them didn't want to help the community but i think that student should perform community service because we not let down the student who wants to go and help the community because if u say the student will not perform community some of student will think that this is unfair and they will not agree with this decision. all i have to say is that student should perform community. have a great decision and also thank you.",2.5,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.5,2.4,0
3103,DBDE16551908,"I think the best way is to work as a group. You might ask why. is the best way students get to learn, For example; I'm the type of student that like to hear about peoples opinion. By listining to other people opinin give the other student a idea on how the project or the assigment should be done. When student get the chance to express they idea they feel confident no fear to express themselve.

Many students like to work bby themselve, therefore no other student interrupt the by asking to many question. Most of them already have a topic to talk about they already have a plan. For Example student that work alone they mostly working at their own pace, working alone give then the chance of finishing on time.

Working as a group give the student the chance of dividing the work in different sections, For example; this student would do this part, the pther student would design the project, the other student would do the research. Dividing the project in different part let the student look or choose the part the thing is easy to do ot they know how to do it already.

Student get to meet new people, by doing a project like a group student somtime don't get to choose who they work with, The profesor might give the students a group of people they never meet before. working as a group with new people let you find a new ways to work or write. For example you meet this new student who make a T chart and write the good about this topic and the negative side about the topic next to it. After looking at it he decide what side he should talk about.

You get things done a lot faster by doing in groups as I said before working with a group let the work get done a lot faster, it's give the people the chance of focusing and the part they have to get done. If you finish your part of the project or assigment, you can volunteer to help other team mate. For example someone that works by themselve might need more time, because she's working by her self and you get the chance to volunteer to help her out on something, she might found difficult to do.

In my conclusion, working like a group it teach the students to listen to other peoples thoughts and, it's the best way students work as one. But other peolpe would say that working alone is the best choice, because it teach the student how to make decision on their own and how they should write their own paper with anybody helping them out.

2367,AFC600D922F6,"I agree because being yourself is very hard sometimes and feel a lonely. Today is in the world nobody like to be all by themselves but some people like to be themselves. If you being yourself you can able to do more work because nothing else to do and feel like board so let study something, work hard. How about your fun time go out with someone, you can't be work hard all the time because that is not a good experience. So I do sometime fun myself and be yourself It's doesn't means you can do any a good stuff. You can do something what is make you feel a happy all your life. don't feel strange yourself and being strong.

First, I like be myself sometime because that make me bring my own idea and also help me figure our myself. What is a good thing or what is a bad thing for me. That make me strong because I using my own bring and think twice myself before I do something. My first year was be American be myself without Family, I feel very sad, and I sad to myself I never want to be myself my life again. I want to go back where are I am came From, I don't want to be in American anymore because know language very important for me that time. I don't understand any English that time and I don't have any Friends. I still remember how hard the was being yourself and I never knew be yourself Will be that hard, Now I know.

Second, after couple years I make my own choose I wan to be myself but no more sadness. So what I did was no looked what other people do and people I ignore with Friends they're all together or family because that make me sad. I could't told you how bad that feel was for me and I relax everything will be fine, I take deep bread. Now I don't worry about be myself anymore because now I know that wasn't that bad after you use to and also, infect that make me a little bit more independent.

Third, Now I responsibility everything myself and be myself that make me diff rant. My last year was raft because my faster Family said to me you have to learn do stuff by yourself. I am so norvise because I can't do anything whiteout them so I have to learn be myself before turn eighteen.

3427,EB1500B8EA75,"Some students who live far away from their schools; they prefer to attend classes from their home instead of going to a school, attending classes from their home can affect some students education and affect their live in a future beacuse not all of the students who are taking online classes are going to complete their work .In my opinion I think is a bad idea to attend classes from your home because students can get distracted for anything, not complete their work and get bad grades.

If we have online class it can be hard to these people who got distracted for anything .Once I had a friend her name was Generic_Name, and she had a online math class that she needed to be able to graduated. One day I went to her home like at 6:00 pm after shool and she was working in her online class, but honestly Generic_Name was not really woking in what she suppose to be working on, yes she had her cumputer on and her online class open , but she was getting distracted by the her tv show just because she like the beaty and the best she stop doing her work. My friend Generic_Name she suppose to do her work but she always got distarcted by her tv show, if she had deside to turned off her tv she didn't got distarcted by anything and she could be success in her online class.

Students who attend classes from their home as there is anyone who is reminding them to completen the work some of them forgot to get it done and they had an incomplete work. This year I am taking an online class and sometimes I forget that I have to be doing all my requested assingments, and by the end of last week I got a bad score because i didn't complete my Vocabulary assingment. If I had put a alarm every day to remind me that i have tostudy and complete my asssiments i could get a better score.

Some others will say that attending classes from home can be a good idea because they can work on in any time,however,others may say that is a bad idea beacuse they can get bad grades. Some classmate that are taking online classes they aren't reading all the directions that the class is giving ;they are just doing the work without reading and that can affect their grades. Having bad grades can made you to not pass your school year, but if we efort we can be great.

For some students is consider to take online classes, but in some point can affect them in their education. There are many students who have online classes and they are falling because they dont have enough help, and some of they because they are not doing it .If schools provide after schools help for online classes will be helpful for all student who needed to be more success, and feel more confortable while they are doing their work and also teachers to be cheking if students are able to pass.

For example right now am doing a sol if i aim to high in order to pass and reach 12th grade and to get my diploma my aim can a low and i can still have a achieve my mark .

Everday you do more you learn more, you acomplish more as long as you believe, and have the heart for it .I don't like braging about my self but I am allways doing something. Right now i am 18 and belive it or not i own two busniss. I make good money but it everday is a struggle to keep the busniss runnig good and going to school but i never once thought about stoping here i wana do more i wana be sombody .

Frist, reason why i agree with Thomas jefferson is becuase if your idle you will never make it out i promise here is a example Donald Trump he is one of the richest people in America and he has his own air plane decraded with 24k gold so you know he has accomplished a lot of things he can be retired living in a island right now but right now instead he is the president of united states you know why becuase he is not a idle person he wants to do more like what Ragin(rip to thats mans) said ""dont ask what your country could do for you ask what you can do for your country"" and that is what Donald is doing right now he is doing more and acomplishing more .

also, its okay to be idle some times we humans everydody needs a little break just as long as you believe. And make goals for your self you will be alright.

1496,736E8C8444E6,"Had the technology a negative or positive effects on people's lives? People are having a negative effects with the technology, I think people can't control it. At this time everybody are forgeting how beutiful is lives with out technology. We can do alot of things with out it. For example: Play outside with friends, go to libraries, and stay outside with natural. Some people say the kids have to have limitation of what they doing on they computer or cells phones. On the other side people say that is good for teenager having not limitation because they can learn more. I think teenager need a limitation of what they doing in the phones. Furthermore parents should cheking what they doing in the internet.

However, some people think is good for teenager not having a limitation because they learn more for their future. On the other hand some people say that that tenenager can't complete a taskd with out having contact with other person. I thinbk having a conversition with other is good because you get to know that person and also get stronger the relationship. When you meet a strager in the internet is dangeous, not everyone is a good person. Some parents think that the kids are just playing in the internets but they do not. I think having a conversiation to you or playing games without speaking I think that have a limitation until you know well that person.

In addition, sometimes people used to buy alot of things from the internet without knowing that person, that is dangerous. People that are seeling on wedsides that always offer what the really have or maybe they just want the money. If you going to buy anything for the internet just make sure the wedside is safes. Buying staff for the internet is getting wrong because people do not want to go aout and spend time with family. Since wedsides liike Amazon, Ebay, and others came up people atart get all they need from wedside. Bad people are used this on favor to them, they are creating so many fake wedsides to racket people.

To continue with, I think a good way to get the kid out the technology is take them to have fun outside like hand out with friends, having friends in a computer like into a videogame or a social media is not healty for the kids. You have to get to know the person before play or talk to them. Sometimes people trick the kids ask them to do bad things.

That why technology shoul not be allow for kid at all or if parents decide to give a cells phone or a computer always have to be a limitation.

Technology does not aloww people to complete task with out haave a contact with others. I think this is having a negative effects on people lives, people are getting racket because they used to maney wedsides. Wedsides are not save you have to have a limitation and also take care of the like. Kid are also getting into the technology they are losing their childhooh.

867,42587039161D,"Do you think technology is helpful ? I think Technology allows people to do many stuff and i think its postive because that way if you have to go buy grocery you can just go grocery shopping online something else why i think it is positve is because pepole can also work from home like lets say if you work in a offiice you can use your laptop so that is what i think about this. For example when my sister feels sick or does not have time to go grocery shopping she goes online and she gets her grocery deliverd in front of the house.

Another reason why i think it is postive because lets say if you dont drive and need a ride you can download the app uber and get yourself a ride to go where you would like to go. Another reason is if you need to clothes shopping there is no worries because you can aslo go online and see what you want to buy if you dont have time to go in the store to see what u need you can always go online. something else is you do not have to go to the book store because you can read online and even check out books. you can bisically do everthing online pay your payments so many stuff these are some reasons why i think tecnology has been positve in peoples lives. Also another good reason is my grandma lives in Generic_City and now we can also facetime her from a diffreant country thanks to technology. One reason why it could be negative because if pepole order stuff and dont go out to buy somehting in the store they are not getting enougeh extracise and they are just being really lazy. Another reason why it could be a negative is nowadays pepole dont even talk face to face all they do is either text call stuff like for example when i go over my grandmas house for any holidays my cousins they dont communicate all they do is sit there be on there phones these are some negative reasons.

So these are some reasons why i think technology is positive nowadays. Another good example is when i go to Generic_City or travaling anywhere what my older sister does is she checks us in so that way we dont have to wait in the big line at the airport and we already have our seats picked so that is also a good thing. like i said in the top paragraph in my postion technolgy has been really halpful for pepole. you can really do anything with your phone you can also pay with apple pay if you leave your wallet at home that is something you can do pay with apple pay.

Everyday, when we wake up we need to think about today what is plan we need to finished? do not lazy, many people need dream. One reason, If we attitude to think about what is plan need to finished ,we don't feel boring., we feel a lot power. For example: the students will know next class should be taking the test ,the students plan to study tonight ,they do study guide, more practie during the test they will get good great.

I think your students should have community service but i think its only fair to the people that do something bad to do community service, because for example some of the students at school litter and if they do and you catch them you should make them do community service for littering. not all students should do that only the kids that act up because if you put all the kids in that your gana be taking their time away and its gana be worst there gana get mad.

1759,856351253492,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" Will if you try will you be able to grow more? Does it matter what you eat? What can you do about you height? I disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson because i dont think that you can make yourself taller. He say if you try will it even work? I still think if you try it wont work because the height we have now is because our father in heaven made how we are now.

First, it doesn't matter if you try or not your height and how you look it comes from your parents genes, and it can also come from another family member. I don't think that you can do anything about your height because it depends on your family too. Even if you try you all you can do is to try to have a nice body, but about you height i don't think you could get taller then you already are. The only thing that can change is your body what i mean is if you chubby, over weight you can do excuse so you can have your body the you once wanted to have. If you really skinny you can eat a little bet more, but if you like how your are now you dont have to change anything. But like i always say ""Love yourself and how you look no matter what people say, the only one who could change you is yourself.""

Second, I don't think you can make yourself taller because there is no way that you can become taller then you already are , and don't you think that the really short people will be taller by now then shorter.

I think that they would not like to be short because in this world there is really mean people that will laugh about others, or how they look, and how short they are. So that is why I think that there is no way to make yourself taller.

Don't you think that short people will be short, and be laugh at no they would not like that son that is why i disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson.

In the other hand, it does matter to eat healthy so you can be in shape and you will be in this life longer. Normally you can do anything about your height because trust me if you could i've been taller by now. I don't like to be short because sometimes i get judged by my height, or how i look, and how chubby i am and i would like to have everything perfect like all those ladies and girls in the magazines or in the TV shows, and i would like to be 6 .3 ft tall then 5.3 ft. So yeah they is no way to change how you look , but by fixing yourself like: Appalachians, surge, and other things you understand what i mean right.

So that means that i still disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson because there is no way that people can make them self taller because even short people or person will be the size or shape they will like to be. This world is not that perfect because if it was everything or everyone will be how they world want to be in this world. So that is why i disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson as you can see i give reasons and examples.

This goes to the person that ready's my story please give me a changes to pass just one i have never pass an SOL before and i will be really happy if you could pass me just once in my life. On this one i have tried my really best so you could understand me what am talking about.

So please please please i beg you am just asking for just once; but if i don't pass thank you for taking your time on reading it; plus English is my second language and i dont understand it that much, and i can't read it that well either.    ",2.0,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,0

I disagree my first reason is,is you can try to do different things and help your future. My second reason is, don't be shy to do all things different. Last reason, don't be your self all the time because you never going to to know the world the you live and you never going to know your self if you never do different things.

You can try to do different things and help your future; For example if you want to do something in you life you need to start thinking about something, because in my family my sister past for the same thing the she was wasting time, but one day my mom took to her about her future if she don't start to thinking, and today she is a doctor because she stop doing the same things the she already have done.

Don't be shy to do all things different; For example my dad is was scare to do his company because he things all the work is going to be so different, and I told him if you never going to try different things we never going to grow in the future. and now we the company and the work in good, and help him a lot because hi try hard to do it.

Don't be your self all the time because you never going to know the world the you live and you never going to know your self if you never do different things; For example my mom she always said be your self all the time but one day I told her mom that is not great because if you be your self all the time you not going to rich want you want in life because your self like to do the staff the are simple are self don't like work hart to rich are gold in life.

This are are the words that British Minister Winston Churchill once said, and I am totally agree with him, to failure without loss of enthusiasm will creeate a person with experience and knowledge.

Once

I fail one time people think that I am a losser, but I see it in different way because I learned what

I did wrong in the first place, and I can fix the problem to make it perfect the second time. Moreover, every single mistake that I make give the opportunity to be success in life, so

I will never give up for any reason.

This remind a few years ago when I was in nine grade when my class took a test and I could not do it, so my teacher involve him self to make it try again as mush as I want it, so I decided to try the second time and still fail, for the first time in my life

I was going to give up, until my mom told me if you never fail and keep trying you are different than others. Hardly, but I decided to try again and this time the third time I new every single question and at the end I was the kid with the best score in class. if you ever thought about giving up with your first mistake you're wrong or because you fail one time you will never be successful, keep trying until you overcome every silgle obstacle.

Many people that are simbly of knowledge and success now were failure once. The important role that failure play in persouit of success. Failure show what kind of people I am and from where I coming, what makes me special and different from others.

On the other hand, people might say once you fail you will keep failing for the rest of your life or that I will never be successful person, but all what people say

I can use it to improve my self.

To resume, what the Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said "" success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.""? Its absultely true, if one day you want tio be succesful person you have to learn that there will be mistakes and fails no once,twices or maybe more times, but do not lossing enthusiasm will keep you in right way.

I'm agree with Emerson's statement what I already know that's a adventage for us . because it is easy doing something what we have already know ,but if we never try it , and we never know if we can do it, I need improve my self and switch my position that's a new goal . so many people they do not bealive them self , well we born poor people , so nothing is imposible ,trying what we want to do in the life . with the time we can get , and reach what we always dreaming.

You will never grow up , if you doing the same things in the life there is I lot opportunity in the world choose a new goal you will see so many change on your way don't give up.

It's easy doing what I already know because we feel comfortable doing ,for example on my work , I'm working busboy helping the server we working team work ,and easy but the problem is want to be a server but they never let me to try it i want to grow up swith a position to earn more money.

Creater a new things , we have so many skill to grow up don't be afraid doing or tying new things we want to improve us self I don't like to stay the same place doing the same things I don't see any improve on my life your life can be change a week but you have to be a positive ,don't give up , try it, isn't nothing bad.",2.0,2.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.4,0
2439,B548BF7A2A8F,"Hello, my name is Generic_Name. I'm student in the Generic_School, and the reason for this letter is because I have give my opinion about what I thing about the British Prime Minister said about the success.

I agree with the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill for this reasons: Failure in want pursuit your success do you make wrestler in the life, failure in want pursuit your success this one can do you make better in the life, and failure in want pursuit your success do you make more strong in pursuit your success.

The first reason failure in want pursuit your success do you make wrestler in the life I thing that because every day fight for want pursuit you success but many times failure in things but continued fight every day. Also I thing that because if you effort every day you fight for pursuit your success and that do you make a wrestler in the life.

The second reason is failure in want pursuit your success this one can do you make better in the life, I thing that because when you commit one failure this teach you to don't make that failure again. Also I thing that because when you failure that help you to want overcome more every day and make better.

The third reason is failure in want pursuit your success do you make more strong in pursuit your success I thing that because the failure give you knowledge in the life and help to make the correct in the life. Also I thing that because when you failure that help you to overcome.

I agree with the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill for all the reasons that can help you to pursuit you success though failure many times but you can overcome all the failures if you don't loss the enthusiasm, all can be more easy when you have enthusiasm and when you want continued forward with you life and pursuit your goals.

3052,D9D8AB28BD26,"I disagree with Emerson, because if you try to do something different of what you are doing you will grow.

But if you cap doing that same thing you will never grow. For example in your life you do different thing to know more about that world , you esperiment diferent thing to know thing that other people don't know to becme strong person and I thing doing different thing you will grow. For example when you are became father & mon you change you experiment thing that you never imagiane how that work. Like some people they still acting like kids I thing is because they talk we person they are not they age, they talk to young men like there age is 17 & 19 this you men they still dont know how to act like men, when there age is 40,

thas how you will never grow. Because a men change to a men is when they are 25 this is that age that you are change thing , and thas way people get old and they still act like kids.

Other people grow fast because I thing that wey how that family teache , like in all family they are not same they grow in difernt tipe. like some family star teach to there kids thing that they dont be doing , try to teache the better thing. For example when they are having diner all together in a restaurante some perent talk to there kids before they go in. they are having the food they need to be put off they table & phone ,to not talk when they have food in there mause at that time you star grow. in the fulture you be different that other people. like whent you goint to othere hause you will be better person for example your friend they you hey what are goint to do after school you like to have diner whit my family you know more beter thas how your perent teach when you are kids. Because when you are youn men and you still know how that work you will cap doing that wey how you learn Like other family they dont that ,when they are eat they use table &phone that wey you will never grow,you get to old person and you will cap doing that same thing that you be doing when you where a kids and i thing you main dont grow.",2.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.4,0
1969,950729DE3582,"Duke Ellington was a jazz legend of his time. One quote he said,"" A problem is a chance for you to do your best."" I will explain the meaning behind this. And if i agree with this or disagree. Let's begin on the meaning first.

The meaning that he is saying is that form your problem you can make it better for your self. To see your problem you can teach your self to do better. That not to give up on your problem. That something bad can turn good. This quote is trying to modevant you.

I agree with this statement. Something bad will in fact turn something good. Not all bad thing will turn bad

As long as you can make them turn out good. You just have to see a chance to do so. Duke Ellington also may of had the same problem.

Duke Ellington was a great jazz ,but was also so a great person. That something bad that can turn to something that is good is very modevation. I agree with this very much. This is what it means and my opinion on the statement.                                    ",2.5,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.3,0
2306,ABF21C9A2160,"Are we the future.? Ralph Waldo Enderson said."" To be yourself in a world that is costantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishement."" I agree with the statement of Enderson. May be some people will disagree with me. So I think is hard to be yourself in a world that is constantly changing because technology and social norms.

First the new inventes and advances in technology has brote new changes to our lives. We live in a world that is sorrounded by new advances in technogy. This has become essential and indispensable to preform our daily activities. For example the internet has become very important tool and so essential that we can't stay with out internet for even a day. We costantly surfing the social media. even if we love and hate social media we are always conected. We want to know what others think about us. With out knowing we fall in a new world call internet and we make chages just to be acepted, love even hate by othes.

Second we are part of a big sociaty. We born, grow up and died in a sociaty that has norms that we fallow. This norms sometime are written norms that are laws and if we brake this laws the sociaty can punish and we face consequences. Some norms are just unwriten norms that we fallow in our daily life. This norms can restrict our selve expretion and can stop us for doing what we want. So to fit and be aceted we fallow the social norms. For example if we go to school we must fallow thier rules to be able to get in school. We can't just walk in with a sexy litle dress and havy make up. The norms of the school are make for your to fallow the dress code. Even if you feel like the dress code restrict your personality and selve expretion. this norms are make for everyboby to mantain a the order and balance.

In conclution I must said that I agree with Enderson's quote "" to be yourself in a world that is costantly trying to make your something else is the greatest accomplishement."" therefore we emgrace new technology and follow social norms to keep the balance and maintain the order. We are part of a change together we can achieve new ideas and build a better sociaty.

So we can leave a better future for our childrens.              ",2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.5,0

No, i don't represent the character traits ,i would like the British naturalist and politician to choose the character traits ,i also know that we must allow the British naturalist ,and politician to choose the character of the government to help raise the to help the US institutions and American individual who pass through the management that also cannot gain experience.

Therefore,American government should help the people to give or allow bass positions and cannot gain experience, i also give the opportunity by those who are one and highly options to develop the habits of passing out freedom for all African

Americans,and American .that will help avoid racism to people in America and also the make the politician allow Americans to vote""i can do to achieve it ""and i will also brainstorm my idea to help me do the right thing to do to help the British and they a saying that""I CAN DO ALL THINGS THROUGH CHRIST WHO STRENGHTEN ME""this proverbs drawn me to help my fellow ones and also to achieve the little things thats letting me become a great person in the future some people achieve the smaller things that help them succeed

Another significant attitude is that these These Americans, is counted to give the logical manners of American that have the right to have the need to whatever pleads them ,like food,clothing,and all other resources i would love to help the government provide, but in all honesty, i also think we can manage stuff beyond our control by letting the president know what the government stuff in American will need to in other to help the homeless shelter and also providing whatever they request for like money,food and other kind in other to help them shine and happy .and helps me gets close to my family closely by going home to do my assignment ,eat .but when i also get home, i rest and do my laundry i try keeping my clothes clean everyday .

finally,my conclusion of other feelings and emotions is also what make me a great,if not the best candidate for the position which i was providing since i was younger ,i have always been an active and responsible person ,who can help others and i also know its vital in others workplace in my power to work on anything i could be responsible for in other to help the state department help to provides all the goods that needed for all Americans and also do what its allowed to do by paying out your tax to help builds school,help people when they in need and also help the government pay off stuff to support.

my mom always puts me to clean the house but every time i went to do the cleaning, she used to say ""you din't clean here or ""you are missing a part of the floor that still is dirty"" so i just say to my self next time i'm gonna clean better in this part of the room and i keep smiling not given up.

To learn how to clean the house in a perfect way i decided to clean the house every Saturday so i can practice more , it passed two month and then i went to clean again and i mop the floor , clean the windows , clean all the tables,so i finished and my mom says great job you now know how to clean in a perfect way!!.

However from what think if you are alone out of no where and you don't have any exprerience is much better because you get to have your experiences and no one bothers yours plans. You make your own decitions and follow your own rules. On the other hand if you have some one on your back that do have more experiences them you they will be correcting you and bodering bothering you. Some people think that is better to follow some one decitions, but others think that is better to be alone because you must create your own decitions and follow yours rules is like you have a family no one is going to correct what are going to do with your family you don't follow others people they may be incorrect and you are correct and is better to be alone becuse you make your onw family whit your decitions and your rules.

To begin alone is better because you make your experiences from the mistakes.

you make your own decitions, but went you make a decition that coust you a mistake you get to have more experiences from the mistake that you did and went you have experiences from the mistake you learnd from the mistake that you need to be more responsible went you have a mistake you get to have a big experiences and that make you more strong and what you do and that makes you feel good and you become more responsible from the things that you do form the experiences that you have some people see that and they will have a hope on you and that you are going to be some one in the future and they will know you better because you are alone and not with some one that has more experiences you will raise you and your decitions.

Another think is that you must follow your own rules that you make. When you make your own rules no one is going to say some think to you they will follow your rules if they want to be with you however if you are with some one that has more experiences you must follow their rules and you dont want that to happent went you make your own rules and follow your rules you will know what is goint to happen but if you follow some one else rules you must be awear because you dont know what is going to happen, so is better to make your decitions your rules because you know that is good from what are you going to do so make your own rules and follow your own rules dont follow some one else rules you become more strong and more smart person.

Fanally the last reason why you should be aonle is that no one is going to bother you you will make every thing in your hands and no some one else hand they will not be on your back bothering you you will make every thing posible on your hand and if you are alone you will become and expert on the jod,company,schools the things that you do you will be the head on your decitions and you are no going to use some one else head and if you use their head they will correct you in what you do and if you do is like from what they thing is better ithey will be bodering you and that is not to good because it will be bad why it will be bad? Because they will make where do you walk in a way that you must don't want to walk they will make every thing possible to walk in their way and you want to walk in your way thier will make every thing possible they will bother you and no yuo must follow your way and your road to make every thing possible to have your own experiences and your own rules.

Afther that, so many people are rude, bute we need to be humbly every time, also we can demonstrate humbly, when we go in the bus sad hi or good morning, also in the morning when we get up sad good moring to the parents, or every time sad thanks when person give you somthing, and not to be impolite.
